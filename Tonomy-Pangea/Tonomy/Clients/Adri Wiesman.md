I am a technical specialist in the field of Internet-of-Things (remote sensing and remote control) and Blockchain (Distributed Ledger Technology and its applications). Being also a keynote-speaker on these subjects I am known to infect others with my passion and enthusiasm about technology. In my function of co-founder of BlockchainLab Drenthe foundation I develop real-world blockchain applications and lecture on blockchain at a University of applied science.  
  
I love to organize Hackathons (been doing that for more than 5 years now)  
Technology is changing the world at high speed and I am constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible (innovation is the art of making impossible things possible).

Blockchain-evangelist, spreading knowledge, insights and enthusiasm about a broad spectrum of Distributed Ledger Technology. Building a network of DLT-enthusiasts and DLT-companies, exploring the fast evolving DLT-landscape, building DLT-applications and enabling others to do also.  
- Public speaking about all facets of Blockchain
