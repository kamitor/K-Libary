Dear Marbella International University Centre,

My name is Chris and I am a teacher from the University of Applied Sciences Windesheim. I specialize in teaching subjects such as Business, Agile, Web 3.0, Data Science, Supply Chain, and IT. I also run several Labs focused on Supply Chain and new technology.

I am currently in Feungirola for the next two months, providing online courses and starting initiatives online. While here, I have come across your university and would like to expand my professional network in the area.

I would be honored to visit your university and meet with some of your teachers, as well as learn more about the programs and initiatives you have in place. Additionally, I would be happy to give a guest lecture to your students, if they would be interested in listening to an class in English.

Looking forward to your response,

Christiaan Gerardo Verhoef
