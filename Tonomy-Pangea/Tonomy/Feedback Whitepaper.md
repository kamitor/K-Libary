Colours are wierd? - Stick to the theme
The opening quote is bad - animation is fun, but does it add?
 

Why lead with White Label? Doesnt tell me what the product does
Doesn't tell me why you made it
What is the problem we are trying to solve
Page 10 - Confusing - What are you trying to tell me
Quote page 11- Very Good, but where is the followup? With tonomy you CAN have this
Page 13 - Allthough I am a big fan of animations and design, this is a whitepaper; The animations are Confusing and take me away from the paper. - Again, What are you trying to acomplish with this slide?
Page 14 - It's.. almost good; But this actually makes me less eager to try. This is a good slide for animation though:
- 26 % of companies will have a data breach this year, resulting on XX $ loss. 
- 34% of companies still don't have their security up 
- Trough the unique intergration method with tonomy ID, 87% of these attacks are negated and 100% of the impact of these attacks 
Slide 14: You're still trying to convince (or educate) me of this product, I would have expected something else by now, Business model, Token distribution, Success stories
Slide 15: good slide, needs to come earlier! Also example of a good slide :) Links to details, to the point. 
Slide 16: If you do a comparison in words, do a comparison in picture too. The pictures need to match the story
Slide 17: Icon mismatch? Desktop Web ..? What does this slide show that I do not already know?
Slide 18: <3 YEASH! Now WITH animation!!!
This slide needs to be slide 3-5 ! this is the HOW
WHY *We believe that we not need to be attached to each other in order to be connected to each-other * (commercial idea :P)  \
In the digital world of the future, everything is communicating
WHAT Keep systems containerized but connected
HOW
Slide 22 incomplete
Also a technical value proposition is *usually bad*
Slide 24: Why is this here? What is it telling me? What does this do?
Slide 25: This is good! Needs animation
Slides 26: YEAHHHHH: some text upgrades but besides that!
Slide 27: good, different fonts and colors: Do not mention eiDAS not being supported for one-click 
*the one click feature is OVERRATED*
Slide 28 : very good needs animation
Slide 29: Very good, we need one uniform way of showing a diagram
Slide 30: didnt we already have this?
Slide 31: ... no this is new :D and I like it; Needs a bit of introduction to what I am really looking at
| We will now show you how: X works | Remeber, it should read likea  bookwork, I should WANT to keep reading.

Slide 32: small design mistake
Slide 33: Very good, should be earlier!

Slide 34: Very nice! 
Slide 35: Stop saying that EIDAS is not supported!
Yes its important; But not in the whitepaper, you don't mention that it's not compatible with the Tesco's giftclub card either. Unless you have said that you're compatible with all giftclub cards.
You're TOO HONEST. There is a difference between honesty and spilling your guts out. 
Slide 39 Double?
slide 40 Completly different color schemes
You've written out a diagram, or animation.
Slide 41: What do you want me to get out of this slide.
"effectively into a decentralized data storage system"
Slide 42: ah, I see now;
Maybe lead with Problem -> Solution -> Diagram
Slide ... 45: another Technical ... what!?
Slide 46: very impressive. 
Slide 48: WE CAN DO THIS? NOOooooooooooooooo.
**NO WAY. JACK ! IF WE CAN DO THIS! STOP STOP STOP STOP.**
We need to get a marketing budget then. We need to get investors.
**THIS IS A FULL FEATURE AND APP ON ITS OWN.**

Slide 50: want to test this
Slide 53: Nice
