```The script goes like this: "Are you busy with approving where projects go" "Do you think projects could move faster?" "Do you want to give people insights into all the process steps that projects go trough?" 

Introducing Civic "Screenshot platform" A project management tool that helps create insight into projects, so that citizens, policy workers, lawkeeps and all other government officials can give insight into all the effort that goes into making citizens's dreams come trough, and to allow citizens to take an active intrest by" 

"proposing" [Screenshot creation} 
"following" [Screenshot history]
"voting" [Screenshot voting] " 
and following" [Screenshot map] The good work of your local municipality; so that you execute the projects that citizens need and show the humans behind the process; 

So that you that you create the city of the future, and show that your city can go faster and do more on a day to day level. 

But surely this coudn't be done fast? Secure? Cheap? Yes it can With Tonomy id [ Tonomy id screenshot ]

We can create a single login system that can connect to all kinds of different tools within your organisation [Email, Teams, drive] To easily validate and connect multipule systems to one. 

All with the most secure system to date With the greatest user experience By keeping essential information on the device of the user, we can create standard data-objects "VC" and "DID" to exchange information which be accepted by any modern system, making it a bridge between multipule applications.

And because all of the essential acction happens on a per-user device [vid device] we can have the most advanced cryptology happen behind the screen, while the user only needs to input one password. This makes tonomy ID an great way to keep information secure
