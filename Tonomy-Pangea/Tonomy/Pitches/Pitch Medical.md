Hospitals are struggling to find enough personnel and beds to allocate to patients, due to the high demand for medical care brought on by the pandemic. The medical system is not equipped to handle this surge, leading to burnout among healthcare workers and declining employee morale. The report also found that 60% of patients prefer in-home or community care over hospital care, due to the increased use of telehealth and remote patient monitoring during the pandemic. Telehealth engagement is 11 times higher than pre-pandemic, with over 60% of primary care now occurring virtually. Pricing transparency and surprise billing initiatives are continuing to pressure the industry, with increased penalties for non-compliance. The last 15 years have seen healthcare reforms aimed at improving hospital care quality and reducing costs, leading to a decrease in the number of hospital facilities and beds, as well as a shift towards more integrated and efficient patterns of care.


The healthcare industry is facing several challenges, including staffing shortages, declining employee morale, and increased administration tasks, such as pricing and process standardization. These issues are further complicated by the shift towards in-home and community care and the rise of telehealth, which has accelerated during the pandemic.

To address these challenges, we introduce our GDPR-compliant Single Sign-On (SSO) software. Our solution is designed to simplify the complex and often confusing world of healthcare administration by providing secure and streamlined access to patient data and systems.

With our SSO software, healthcare providers can save time and reduce errors by eliminating the need for multiple usernames and passwords. Our solution is GDPR-compliant by default, meaning that patient data is protected from unauthorized access and that privacy requirements are met from the outset.

In a market where privacy and security are increasingly important, our SSO software stands out as a solution that provides peace of mind. Our software helps healthcare providers to stay ahead of the curve and focus on providing high-quality care to patients, instead of struggling with complex administration tasks.

WHY: With the rise of telehealth and the shift towards in-home and community care, the healthcare industry is facing complex administrative tasks.

HOW: Our GDPR-compliant Single Sign-On (SSO) software simplifies these tasks by providing secure and streamlined access to patient data and systems.

WHAT: With our SSO software, healthcare providers can save time and reduce errors, while also protecting patient data from unauthorized access.

Problem:

In today's digital world, managing and accessing personal information has become increasingly complex. With the rise of data privacy regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), organizations face the challenge of storing personal information securely while still making it accessible to authorized personnel.

Market Opportunity:

With the growing need for secure and streamlined personal information management, there is a large market opportunity for an SSO solution that is GDPR compliant by default and addresses the complexities associated with managing personal information.

Invisioned Solution:

Our SSO solution stores information at the patient, making it the center point of information. By doing so, we aim to solve the complexity associated with personal information management by creating a centralized and secure platform for all personal information. Our solution is GDPR compliant by default, ensuring that all personal information is stored and processed in accordance with the regulations.

Why How What Flow:

-   Why: With the rise of data privacy regulations and the growing need for secure personal information management, organizations need a solution that can help them navigate these challenges.
-   How: Our SSO solution stores information at the patient, making it the center point of information and creating a centralized and secure platform for all personal information.
-   What: The result is a secure and GDPR compliant solution that addresses the complexities associated with personal information management and provides organizations with peace of mind in an increasingly complex digital world.

# Problems Solved
This solution helps solve the following data security problems:

1.  Unauthorized access: By centralizing patient information at the patient level, it becomes more difficult for unauthorized individuals to access sensitive information. This helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access attacks such as hacking and phishing.
    
2.  Data breaches: By storing information in a secure and centralized location, it reduces the risk of data breaches caused by human error or system failure. This helps mitigate the risk of data breaches caused by hacking, malware, and insider threats.
    
3.  Data privacy violations: By being GDPR compliant by default, the solution helps ensure that the privacy of patient information is protected. This helps mitigate the risk of privacy violations such as data selling or unauthorized access by third-party entities.
    
4.  Data loss: By having a centralized storage location, it becomes easier to track, manage and recover data in case of loss. This helps mitigate the risk of data loss caused by hardware failure or natural disasters.
    

This solution helps hospitals maintain their independence by giving them control over their own data, while still ensuring that it is secure and protected from various types of cyberattacks.
