Institutional Void

Working for any big, public funded instition, is considered a noble cause, to serve your fellow citizen so directly can be truly forfilling; To be part of an organisation so big, that you'll never feel alone; But, when you work at such big institutions  it doesn't take very long to realize that there is a lot of duplication of efforts, redudancies, even in people. It becomes hard to figure out what is really going on, who is working where and what happened with that one project that you started a year ago. 
Frustrations mount as decisions are taken all around you, and you might be informed? Might not? And simply organizing these projects, approving them can be a nightmare.
Everything seems to be moving slow until some deadline arrives and then everything has to be done in a blink of an eye. And finding out what has been acomplished afterwards can be proven diffecult.

But what if we could do it differently, what if we had one system to organize all these projects; That kept it's history, that made it easy to audit; 
You might think, we have a 100 different planning tools, we don't really need one more;
No, this is not a planning tool, more of a insight and clearity tool 

When you have this feeling, as an employer, as a manager, or as a minister, it can be hard to imagine what a citizen on the inside thinks about this; 
What does this big institution actually do? How is it, that they spend so much money? Who actually makes decisions? How are those decisions stored and can we have a look?
These questions are becoming more relevant in high-trust countries, where people know that there are processes and rules.
