 
Password Fatigue: According to a study by LastPass, the average employee has 191 passwords. Managing this many passwords can be overwhelming and lead to password fatigue, which can increase the likelihood of password-related security breaches. A federalized SSO identity system can reduce password fatigue by enabling employees to access multiple applications and services with a single set of credentials.
    
	  
Security Breaches: Data breaches are becoming more common, and HR data is often targeted by cybercriminals. A federalized SSO identity system can help prevent security breaches by providing centralized management of user access to applications and services, making it easier to monitor and control who has access to sensitive HR data.
    
Time Spent on Password Management: A survey conducted by Gartner found that employees spend an average of 36 hours per year managing passwords. This time could be better spent on other tasks, such as managing employee benefits or performance reviews. A federalized SSO identity system can reduce the time spent on password management by enabling employees to use a single set of credentials to access multiple applications and services.

Inefficient Processes: Many HR departments use multiple applications and services to manage employee data, such as payroll, benefits, and performance reviews. However, managing these applications separately can be inefficient and time-consuming. A federalized SSO identity system can streamline processes by enabling employees to access all the applications and services they need from a single dashboard.

- Compliance Risks: HR departments are responsible for managing sensitive employee information, such as social security numbers and medical records. Failure to protect this information can result in legal and financial consequences. A federalized SSO identity system can help HR departments comply with data protection regulations by providing centralized management of user access to applications and services.

Compliance Risks

According to a 2021 report by the Ponemon Institute, the average cost of a data breach in the healthcare industry was $9.23 million, with an average of 236 days to identify and contain a breach. This underscores the financial and reputational risks associated with non-compliance with data protection regulations in industries that manage sensitive employee information, such as healthcare.

In addition, a 2020 report by the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) found that the top three most commonly cited privacy compliance regulations were the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). These regulations have specific requirements for data protection and access control, and failure to comply with these requirements can result in significant legal and financial consequences.

A federalized SSO identity system can help HR departments comply with these regulations by providing centralized management of user access to applications and services. By implementing strong authentication and access controls, organizations can ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive employee information. In addition, a federalized SSO identity system can help monitor user activity and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

Overall, these statistics highlight the importance of compliance with data protection regulations in industries that manage sensitive employee information. A federalized SSO identity system can be an effective tool to help HR departments comply with these regulations and mitigate legal and financial risks.
			 


    

Overall, a federalized, custom-built SSO identity system can help solve problems related to password fatigue, security breaches, time spent on password management, inefficient processes, and compliance risks, which are all important considerations for HR departments.



## Security
According to the 2021 Cost of a Data Breach Report by IBM, the average cost of a data breach in the United States was $9.05 million, with an average of 287 days to identify and contain a breach. The report also found that malicious attacks were the most common cause of data breaches, accounting for 52% of all incidents.

In addition, a study by Ponemon Institute found that healthcare, financial services, and education were the top three industries most affected by data breaches. These industries are also likely to have significant amounts of HR data that could be targeted by cybercriminals.

A federalized SSO identity system can help prevent security breaches by providing centralized management of user access to applications and services. By implementing strong authentication and access controls, organizations can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive HR data. In addition, a federalized SSO identity system can help monitor user activity and detect potential security threats before they become a breach.

Overall, these statistics highlight the importance of protecting HR data and the potential impact of data breaches. A federalized SSO identity system can be an effective tool to help prevent security breaches and protect sensitive HR data.
