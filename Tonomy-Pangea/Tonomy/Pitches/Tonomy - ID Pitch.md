introduction: This section provides an overview of the municipality and its IT infrastructure, including the problem it faced with managing access to its multiple small hardware devices and increased security risks.

Problem Statement: This section describes the municipality's problem with managing its critical IT infrastructure, including the issues of increased security risks and high costs associated with networking all its devices.

Solution: This section describes the municipality's proposed solution, the Single Sign-On (SSO) application for user management, developed by a non-profit and open source foundation. The SSO application allows the municipality to manage access to its critical IT infrastructure in a secure and efficient manner, while also reducing the cost associated with networking all the devices.

Impact: This section describes the potential impact of the municipality's solution, including improved security, increased ability to respond to emergencies, and reduced IT support calls. The SSO application is also GDPR proof, transparent and auditable upon request and securely allows credential sharing.

Business Model: This section describes the non-profit and open source foundation's business model and how it developed the SSO application for the municipality.

Team: Why we can do it.

Traction and Funding

Ask: This section includes the specific ask for the municipality to join and implement the SSO application for user management, and how it will benefit the municipality by addressing its critical IT infrastructure management.

Next Steps: This section outlines the next steps for the municipality to join and implement the SSO application and how it can be implemented in the municipality.

1.  number of slides
    4:16 slide is cut in half
    Hypha is out
    a theme should be the same through the presentation
    if I lost the phone, how can I recover all my data? Should be cloud solutions shown
    if it is a cloud solution, how are we different
    your face should be left top corner

    we need to find GDPR real numbers for one SME , like real case how much they pay and how we can save those money
    
  you should mute Jack and do presentation yourself

    it is very low volume of Jack to hear anything

    you can record it yourself as well. You can download it

    presentation should be different video as well, like part 2

    it is good to use Loom as we will understand at which point people quit watching

    overall, very good. But we need to elaborate where will be backup data, what will happen if the cloud gonna be hacked, who gonna provide cloud, value about Tonomy ID

    now we need for CIVIC + TOnomy ID, but Tonomy id as a side tool. should be 15% about Tonomy ID then Civic
    

    85%
    

    that we can use civic for different stuff - anonimous board election election on the country scale, civic participation, company anonimous participation, corruption Alert tool btw
