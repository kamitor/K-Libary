Story

We are moving in an ever more digital world; 
With ever more tools that help us cooperate;

But these tools are becoming increasingly complex
And recient history has shown that these big companies cannot be trusted to deal with our security responsibly;

We require better tools that safeguard our control of systems, tools that allow us to see what really happens, so that even if we don't understand, someone else could; And this makes all the difference.

We need tools that saveguard our autonomy. 



but the systems we are creating are increasingly complex and hard to understand

We know the big cooporations have build tools upon tools to help us cooperate.
but in our willingness to trust them we have agree to give away too many of our liberties
