When I was a young boy, always liked 
We human beings are social creatures, we like to work together

We need to guard our autonomy, our sovereignty.
But not for the sake of Democrasy, FORGET the politics for a moment.

And whenever, we give over our control unwillingly; That's when the horrors start.
When we are bullied into submission, when give ourselves over to machine men with machine minds, thats when the our human values can be used against ourselves.

So for the sake of Humanity;
