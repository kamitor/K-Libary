Identify potential customers: Use online communities, social media, and other channels to identify potential customers who might benefit from your SSO solution. You can also leverage your existing networks and contacts to generate leads.

3.  Use automation workflows: Use HubSpot's automation workflows to automate repetitive tasks and streamline your sales process. For example, you can create a workflow that automatically sends a follow-up email after a customer has downloaded your product brochure.
    
4.  Integrate with social media: Use HubSpot's social media integration to share your content and engage with potential customers on social media. You can create social media posts that link to your product page or blog and track engagement metrics.

Qualify leads: Use your CRM tool to track leads and qualify them based on their fit and likelihood to purchase. You can use open source lead scoring tools like Lead Scoring by OpenERP to help you determine which leads to focus on.

Conduct needs analysis: Once you've qualified a lead, schedule a discovery call or meeting to understand the customer's specific needs and requirements. You can use open source tools like BigBlueButton or Jitsi to conduct remote meetings.

Create tailored proposals: Use the information gathered from the needs analysis to create a tailored proposal that addresses the customer's needs and explains how your SSO solution can help. You can use open source tools like LibreOffice or GIMP to create professional-looking proposals. 


Negotiate terms: Use your CRM tool to track the negotiation process and communicate with the customer about pricing, contract terms, and other details. You can use open source project management tools like Odoo or Taiga to manage the negotiation process.


Close the sale: Once the customer has agreed to the terms, finalize the sale and onboard the customer. Use your CRM tool to track the onboarding process and ensure a smooth transition for the customer.
