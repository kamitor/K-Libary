Slide one:

"In today's fast-paced world, time is of the essence. We understand the frustration and fatigue that comes with multiple logins, paperwork, and complex security systems."

Imagine you're a doctor seeing a new patient, before  trying to access your company's system to get some important work done. You type in your username and password, only to be redirected to another page to confirm your identity. You follow the prompts, and then you're sent to another page to set up a second factor authentication. By the time you finally get access to the system, you're feeling frustrated and fatigued. This process is not only time-consuming, but it also disrupts your workflow and concentration.

Imagine you're a small business owner and you need to apply for a loan to keep your business afloat. You gather all the necessary documents and fill out the application, which takes hours of your time. You submit the application and wait anxiously for approval, but instead, you receive a request for more paperwork and information.

You scramble to provide the additional documents, and once again, you wait for approval. The process drags on, and you start to feel frustrated and overwhelmed. You wonder if you'll ever get the approval you need to keep your business running.

The Challange: slide 2

These processes are in place because when companies don't handle our personal information responsibly, it can feel like a huge violation of trust. We trust these companies with our sensitive data, such as our names, addresses, phone numbers, and even our financial information. When this information is mishandled or stolen, it can leave us feeling vulnerable and exposed.

Not only can this type of situation be emotionally distressing, but it can also have real-world consequences. For example, if our financial information is stolen, we may have to spend a significant amount of time and effort to resolve the issue and protect ourselves from identity theft.

Furthermore, when news of a data breach or mishandling of information becomes public, it can damage a company's reputation and erode consumer trust. This can have long-lasting effects on the company's bottom line and may even result in legal action being taken against them.

In today's world, where so much of our personal information is stored online, it's more important than ever for companies to take the responsibility of protecting our data seriously. When they fail to do so, it's understandable to feel a strong emotional connection to the issue and to be vocal about the need for change.

As an IT professional, you understand the importance of keeping your company's data secure. You've spent countless hours implementing and maintaining complex security systems to protect your organization's sensitive information. However, despite your best efforts, you find that many of your users are still not taking security seriously. They use weak passwords, share confidential information over unsecured networks, and disregard security policies.

You feel frustrated and overwhelmed, torn between the need to make the system secure and the desire to empower your users to take responsibility for their own security. On one hand, you want to create a system that is impenetrable and unyielding to cyber threats. On the other hand, you recognize that the system needs to be user-friendly and accessible to encourage users to follow best security practices.

Now imagine a solution that strikes a balance between security and usability. A solution that not only makes the system secure but also empowers users to be very secure on their own. 
A solution that allows you to take actions faster, approve problems, see what's really going on.

This solution provides easy-to-use tools and clear guidance that enable users to make informed decisions about their action, while staying secure, it allows users to interact with multiple systems at the same time, and transfer information between them, which can be audited, on a per user case.
