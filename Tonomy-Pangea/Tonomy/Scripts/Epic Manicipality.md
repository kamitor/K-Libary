Write a epic for a local municipality to manage it's critical IT infrastructure using a single sign-on application for user management use multiple user stories. The local municipality has several offices and multiple small hardware devices that must be able to be accessed by it's engineers and personnel. Currently the local municipality is unable to do this due to the increased security risk that would come by networking all these devices in addition the cost would be very high. Additionally in case on an emergency it would need to be accessed by multiple different institutions, such as the police, the firebrigade and ambulances. Assume the single sing-on app is GDPR proof, and can be made transparent and audited upon request and securely allows credential sharing and that the creator of the SSO application is an non-profit and open source foundation.


Write a epic for a hospital to manage it's patients using a single sign-on application for user management use multiple user stories. The hospitals has several offices and external doctors and multiple Machines that must be able to be accessed by doctors and in such a way that the appropriate care is given. Currently the hospital is having problems due to increased security risk that would come by networking all these machines and files in such a way that it does not violiate GDPR regulations. Costs of current IT systems to exchange patient file with doctors is very costly and doesn't allow for easy intergration with other hospitals and external medical providers. Additionally in case on an emergency it would need to be accessed by multiple different institutions, such as the police and ambulances. Assume the single sing-on app is GDPR proof, and can be made transparent and audited upon request and securely allows credential sharing and that the creator of the SSO application is an non-profit and open source foundation. Assume that the patient is able to hold on to it's patient file securely and share this with doctors easily and this is the key to the solution.


Problem: 
Municipalities that control infrastructure for bridges and other public works face several challenges when it comes to managing and maintaining these structures. These challenges include:

1.  Data silos: Different departments and contractors within the municipality may have their own systems for collecting and storing data on bridge conditions, which can lead to data silos and a lack of a centralized data repository. This can make it difficult to track the overall condition of bridges and plan for maintenance and repairs.
    
2.  Limited data sharing: Data silos can also make it difficult for different departments and contractors to share data and collaborate on bridge maintenance and repairs. This can lead to inefficiencies and delays in addressing issues.
    
3.  Lack of real-time monitoring: Many municipalities lack real-time monitoring systems for bridges, which can make it difficult to quickly identify and address issues. This can lead to increased risk of bridge failure and costly repairs.
    
4.  Compliance and regulations: With the increasing regulations and compliance requirements (such as GDPR), municipalities are facing challenges in managing and maintaining the data on their infrastructure.
    
5.  Cost: With the increasing costs of IT systems, municipalities often find it difficult to invest in new technology or upgrade their existing systems.


Solution: 

By implementing a SSO solution, municipalities can connect data from different systems without creating a central data repository, removing the incentive for cybercriminals to target the municipality's data. This allows for collaboration and data sharing without increasing the overall security risk. SSO solutions typically provide a secure way of granting access to data without creating a central point of failure, which is a common concern when creating a central data repository. Additionally, SSO solutions allow for access control and auditing, which can further enhance the security of the data.
