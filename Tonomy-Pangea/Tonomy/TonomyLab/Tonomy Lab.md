Problem 

- Bureaucratic and administrative challenges: Innovation and discovery labs within universities often have to navigate complex bureaucratic and administrative processes, which can slow down or hinder the progress of research projects.
- Limited access to industry partners and commercial markets: Labs within universities may have limited access to industry partners and commercial markets, which can make it difficult to translate research into practical applications and bring new technologies to market.
- Limited interdisciplinary collaborations: Innovation and discovery labs within universities may be siloed within a specific department or discipline, which can limit opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations and cross-fertilization of ideas.
- Diffeculty Attacting top Talent: Innovation and discovery labs within universities may struggle to attract and retain top talent, as researchers may be more attracted to opportunities in industry or at other research institutions. This can make it difficult for the lab to sustain a critical mass of expertise and experience over time.
- Limited Funding: Innovation and discovery labs within universities may be constrained by limited funding, which can make it difficult to pursue ambitious research projects and develop new technologies. This can limit the potential impact and reach of the lab's work.
- Commercial Labs Problems: 
	- Short-term focus: Commercial labs may prioritize short-term goals and profitability over long-term research and development. This can lead to a lack of investment in basic and applied research, which can limit the potential impact and reach of the lab's work.
	- Limited academic freedom: Commercial labs may have to navigate competing demands from stakeholders, such as investors and shareholders, which can limit academic freedom and restrict the types of research that can be pursued.
	
	- Lack of transparency: Commercial labs may be less transparent than academic labs, which can make it difficult for researchers, policymakers, and the public to understand and evaluate the lab's work.
	- Lack of diversity: Commercial labs may be less diverse than academic labs, as they may be more focused on specific industries or applications. This can limit opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations and cross-fertilization of ideas.
	- Risk of intellectual property disputes: Commercial labs may be at a higher risk of intellectual property disputes, as their research and development activities may be driven by financial incentives and the desire to protect proprietary technologies.

Market

1.  Research and development for the public good: Non-commercial innovation labs can focus on research and development that addresses public needs and addresses societal problems. These labs can have a direct and meaningful impact on society and can contribute to the public good.
2. Development of technologies for underserved markets: Non-commercial innovation labs can focus on the development of technologies that benefit underserved markets such as low-income communities, remote areas, or developing countries where traditional commercial labs may not find profitable to invest.
3.  Leverage of government funding: Non-commercial innovation labs can leverage government funding, such as grants and contracts, to support their research and development activities. This can enable them to pursue ambitious projects and advance technologies in areas that may not be as profitable for commercial labs.
4.  Collaborations with academic institutions: Non-commercial innovation labs can collaborate with academic institutions to build stronger connections between research and commercialization. These collaborations can provide access to world-class research capabilities, expertise and top-level talent.
5. Development of open-source technologies: Non-commercial innovation labs can focus on the development of open-source technologies, which can be used and adapted by a wide range of stakeholders and organizations. This can enable the development of new and innovative applications, and can support the growth of a thriving ecosystem of innovators and entrepreneurs.

Generally, the European Union has been investing and supporting non-commercial innovation lab through programs such as Horizon 2020, which allocated funding of â‚¬ 80 billion for research and innovation projects between 2014-2020. Also, member states such as Germany, United Kingdom, France, and Spain have their own funding programs and grants for non-commercial and open-source innovation.

Solution

Tonomy Lab: Ethical Open Systems Development

Research Ethical Systems:
Promote and develop new and innovative technologies that cannot pursued by commercial labs, due to lack of short term or even long term monitization goals.

Create GDPR proof technologies that are in line with the SDG's of the European Union.

Facilitate Intergration:

Develop new Education: 
Create transparent and open access to research, which can help ensure that valuable knowledge and expertise is shared widely and can be built upon by other innovators and researchers.



Develop and promote open-source alternatives to proprietary technologies, which can help increase access and lower the barriers to adoption for organizations and individuals

Business Model

1. Services-based: Non-commercial open source labs can generate revenue by providing services such as consulting, training, and technical support to organizations that use their open-source technologies.
    
2.  Grant-funded: Non-commercial open source labs can rely on funding from government grants, foundations, and philanthropic organizations to support their research and development activities.
    
3.  Community-driven: Non-commercial open source labs can rely on contributions from a community of users and developers to support the development and maintenance of their open-source technologies. This model can rely on voluntary contributions of time, money, and expertise from a community of users and supporters.
    
4.  Sponsored development: Non-commercial open source labs can receive funding from industry partners, companies, or organizations to develop and maintain specific open-source projects, it can also be a way of funding to specific research development.
    
5.  Product-based: Non-commercial open source labs can create complementary products or services that build on top of their open-source technologies, such as specialized tools, applications, or services. These complementary products or services can be sold to generate revenue, while the underlying open-source technology remains free and open to the community.
