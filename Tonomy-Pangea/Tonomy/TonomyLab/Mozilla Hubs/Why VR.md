Greg shared this 2017 [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27273896/) that had first-year learners in A&P courses. Greg explained that simulations for A&P courses already exist. However, he was intrigued that this study's results predicted that VR adds an element that simulations cannot; that is

üí°[[VR Fork Pitch]]

VR might increase a user's ability to think spatially, to think in 3D.


From the abstract, ‚ÄúThe results indicated that all students who were exposed to the stereoscopic 3D vascular models in 3D learning sessions increased their ability to correctly identify the head and neck vascular anatomy. Most importantly, for students with low-spatial ability, 3D learning sessions **improved** post session knowledge scores to a level comparable to that demonstrated by students with high-spatial ability indicating that **the use of 3D stereoscopic models may be particularly valuable to these students with low-spatial ability.**‚Äù

These means that VR provides these affordances for A&P instruction:

-   Three-dimensional objects,
-   Learners can move their own avatars,
-   Learners can grab objects and expand and contract the object size,
-   Learners can navigate through layers or systems (see the example video [here](https://nyulangone-immersive-classroom.glitch.me/experiences/ptpfossa/) noting how the arteries and nerves can be shown separately),
-   and due to these affordances, learners can see A&P structures in ways they might not have seen before (for example, putting one's smaller head inside a larger skull)
-
