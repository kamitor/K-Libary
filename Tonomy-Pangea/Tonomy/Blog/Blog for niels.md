As a researcher, I have always been interested in the ways in which data is used online, particularly on social media and through targeted advertising on our mobile devices. It's why I started my studies at : ( university, study) But it wasn't until I began to pay closer attention to my own experiences with these platforms that I truly began to question the implications of data usage online. I started to realize that my every move was being tracked, my interests monitored and my behavior predicted, all for the sake of targeted advertising. It was a wake-up call for me and I knew I had to take action.

In this blog post, I want to share my personal journey of discovery and the insights I gained along the way. I want to be transparent and share my own experiences, to give you an idea of how your data is being used without your knowledge. Through my observations and research, I hope to shed light on the ways in which our data is being used, and the potential consequences of these actions. 

I urge you to join me in this quest for transparency and control over our own data. Together, we can educate ourselves and demand better practices from the companies that collect and use our data. The power is in our hands, let's take control of it. And on this quest I met the Tonomy Foundation, an open source and non-profit lab, that sees these problems too, and decided to do something about it. 

In recent years, we have seen a growing awareness of the need for a safer and more secure way to store and use our identity online. The current system of relying on institutions to issue and store our credentials and personal data has proven to be inadequate and even harmful. The questionable practices of social media giants and other institutions have shown us that our trust in them has been misplaced and that ethical boundaries are often non-existent.

When I spoke to Christiaan Verhoef, at the Tonomy lab, my eyes were opened even futher to what extent systems can be used to set us free or, if implemented wrongly, could be used to control us.
He explained that this technology is similar to something like Nucliar Energy. A benefit and boon for society if used for power generation, or devisating and perament if used as a weapon. 

These new digital systems deserve our attention, not just on how they work, but also in how they are build. 
As a researcher at the University [ ] , I am excited to announce that I will be starting a new project focused on the topic of SSI (self-sovereign-identity) in collaboration with Tonomy Lab. I will be working closely with Christiaan Verhoef, a leading expert in the field of SSI, who will be supporting me in this project.

At Tonomy Lab, we believe that everyone deserves better. We believe that no one should be able to profit off of our personal data, and that it is time to step up and protect our identity. That is why we are committed to building an ethical, democratic and secure digital identity ecosystem with SSI.

As part of this project, I will be conducting research and interviews with industry experts and stakeholders to better understand the current state of SSI and identify areas for improvement. We will also be exploring the potential use cases of SSI in various industries such as healthcare, education, and government.

Additionally, I will be joining the Tonomy Lab at various online and offline speaking events, like at pakhuis de zwager, Upcoming the 30th, where I will be interviewing people on what they think of digital innovation systems in this field, specifically on how they operate.
