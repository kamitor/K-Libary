"Unleashing Prosperity: Navigating the Fine Line between Autonomy and Centralization for supplychain"

Computers and data systems have been around for over 40 years now, if not more, yet 
some parts of the supplychain still have not been digitalized, or fully digitalized. Why is that? 

If sustainability is ethical and most people want this, including those in supplychains, why hasn't this happend yet?

Wait, let me check that, before I make a fool out of myself:
``According to a study by Accenture, as of 2021, approximately 30% of global supply chains have been fully digitalized. The study also found that an additional 45% of supply chains have implemented some digital technologies, but have not yet fully integrated them into their processes. This means that currently 75% of global supply chains are using digital technologies to some degree.``

Although the supply chain industry has made advancements in digitalization, it has not yet reached a level of transparency that allows for meaningful information about the origins and true cost of products to be determined. 
This is evident in the fact that products are still sourced from places with unethical practices, and the use of inhumane mines for resources such as cobalt.

Additionally, it remains difficult to accurately determine the true cost of manufacturing in the supply chain, including the external costs associated with fair wages, proper pollution management, and reducing carbon emissions. 

![[506596a71d912d06449acd83be3bea9e-3401201249.jpg]]These external costs increase the overall cost of products, making it a challenging task for companies to remain competitive while also maintaining ethical practices in their supply chain. 

The lack of accountability in the supply chain also makes it difficult for companies to make the right ethical choices without facing negative consequences in the marketplace.

``A study by the non-profit organization KnowTheChain found that only 3% of companies in their sample had fully transparent supply chains.``

Wait, 3%? Must be that many supplychains use lots of transparency tech by now, why hasn't this taken hold yet?

``Another study by the non-profit organization Transparency International found that only 25% of companies in the S&P 100 index disclose information about their supply chains``

Looks like this should be fixed with a accounting system, that would just reject products that would not meet these demands. With enforced transparency! 

**Why can't we just centralize and standardize these supplychains with blockchain and make sure that we do things right?**

Centralizing data and management can make it easier to track and monitor supply chain activities, but it can also lead to vendor locking, where a company becomes dependent on a single vendor or system. This can make it difficult for a company to switch vendors or systems if they are not meeting their needs, and can also limit competition and innovation in the supply chain.

MERSK, a Danish shipping company, developed a blockchain system called "TradeLens" that aimed to improve the transparency and efficiency of supply chain operations by tracking and managing shipping data on a blockchain platform.

One of the reasons that MERSK's blockchain system failed to get enough of its suppliers onboard is due to concerns around vendor locking. Many of MERSK's suppliers and partners were hesitant to join the TradeLens platform because they were concerned that once they shared their data on the platform, they would be locked into using the platform exclusively, and would be unable to share the data with other platforms or systems.

So maybe Blockchain is not the answer after all? Or maybe there is more to it. This got me thinking about economy, capatalism and one key aspect of it. Autonomy.

Autonomy within an economy is the idea that individuals and businesses are free to make their own decisions without interference from a centralized authority. This leads to prosperity because it allows for competition and innovation, which in turn leads to increased productivity and economic growth. 

Historical examples also support the idea that autonomy leads to prosperity. The rise of market economies in Western Europe and North America in the 18th and 19th centuries, marked by a reduction of government intervention and an increase in economic freedom, led to a significant increase in economic growth and living standards. Similarly, the economic liberalization policies implemented in countries such as China and India in the late 20th century led to a significant increase in economic growth and reduction in poverty.

On the other hand, centralization of an economy can lead to its downfall. When a central authority has too much control, it can stifle competition and innovation, leading to inefficiency and a lack of motivation for businesses to improve. Additionally, centralization can lead to a lack of accountability, as those in power may not be held responsible for their actions.

On the other hand, centralization of an economy, marked by excessive government control and intervention, has been found to lead to its downfall. For example, centrally planned economies such as the Soviet Union and China in the 20th century were characterized by inefficiency, low productivity, and a lack of motivation for businesses to improve. This led to a lack of economic growth and poor living standards for the population.

In summary, autonomy within an economy is a key driver of prosperity, while centralization can lead to its downfall. It's important to strike a balance between the two, allowing for a certain level of government intervention while also maintaining a level of economic freedom.

Supply chain management is the coordination and management of all activities involved in the production and delivery of goods and services. With the rise of digital technologies, supply chains are becoming increasingly digitized, enabling greater visibility, efficiency, and automation. However, as supply chains become more centralized, this can lead to unintended consequences, including increased risk, reduced resilience, and vendor lock-in.

One of the key benefits of digital supply chain management is the ability to collect and analyze data in real-time. This allows for more accurate forecasting, better inventory management, and improved logistics. However, as more data is collected and analyzed, this can lead to a greater dependence on a centralized system or a small number of key suppliers. This can create a single point of failure, where a disruption in one part of the supply chain can have a significant impact on the entire system.

Another unintended consequence of digitalization is the concentration of power in a small number of large companies. With the ability to collect and analyze large amounts of data, these companies can gain a significant competitive advantage. This can lead to a decrease in competition and innovation, as smaller companies struggle to compete. This is a common problem in capitalist economies, where the focus is on maximizing profits, leading to monopolies, and concentration of power.

Web 3.0 technologies, such as blockchain and decentralized networks, could potentially solve these problems by enabling a more decentralized approach to supply chain management. Blockchain technology, in particular, can provide a secure and transparent way to share data and information among all stakeholders in the supply chain. This can promote collaboration, trust, and transparency among all parties, regardless of their size or location.

But we read earlier that Mersk's initiative (which is a web 3.0 initiative) failed due to " not enough of its suppliers onboard is due to concerns around vendor locking."

How can web 3.0 be both decentralized yet, cause centralization?

This is when, at least for me the coin dropped, so to speak.

The technology of mersk was decentralized, but the ownership of the protocol and the software, "Tradelens" was not. The network itself was owned by mersk, which means, even though the technology enabled decentralization, the effect of it was that if you joined, you would be in a centralized system.

In order for these systems to help the supplychain and web 3.0, the platform itself must not be owned by a party that has a direct benefit into locking vendors into that system.
The network ownership, too, has to be decentralized.

Which lead me to where i am now. This is why I have put so much of my time and energy into co-building open source and independant blockchain systems, such as the Open Food Chain and the Tonomy Foundation. 

Independent web 3.0 systems, such as the one developed by Tonomy foundation and the Open Food Chain,create transparency and traceability in supplychains and allows for real-time tracking of food products from farm to table, providing consumers with detailed information about the origin, quality, and safety of the products they purchase. The use of blockchain technology ensures that data is accurate, tamper-proof, and easily accessible to all stakeholders in the supply chain. This increases it's accountability, thus forshadowing real innovation in the realm of sustainability and provenance.

And because these intiatives are owned by all stakeholders, they preserve the autonomy so desperately needed in order to saveguard innovation and flexibility in the supplychains. 

Lastly, the open-source and decentralized nature of web 3.0 systems can provide a level playing field for small and medium enterprises and farmers in the supply chain. SSO and SSI can enable them to assert their ownership and prove their authenticity, which can help them to access markets, and increase their bargaining power.

What is the Open Food Chain?
The Open Food Chain (OFC) is a promising initiative that aims to create transparency and traceability in the food supply chain using blockchain technology. The OFC platform allows for real-time tracking of food products from farm to table, providing consumers with detailed information about the origin, quality, and safety of the food they purchase. The use of blockchain technology ensures that data is accurate, tamper-proof, and easily accessible to all stakeholders in the supply chain. By increasing transparency and traceability, the OFC platform can help to promote food safety, improve the traceability of food products, reduce food waste, and increase consumer trust in the food industry. With the OFC platform, food producers, retailers, and consumers can benefit from a more sustainable, efficient, and transparent food supply chain.

The tonomy Foundation?
The Tonomy Foundation has created an Open Source and Non profit Identity application that incorporate Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and Self-Sovereign Ownership (SSO) which potentially help the supply chain in decentralized and secure management of data, which can help to increase transparency and trust in the supply chain. 

By giving individuals and organizations control over their own data and identities, SSI and SSO can help to reduce the risk of data breaches and fraud, and make it easier to track and verify the identity of individuals and organizations in the supply chain.
