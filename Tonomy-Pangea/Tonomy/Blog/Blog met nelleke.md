Our exploration of Ideas by costumer for Lego, Participation with Civilians and Innovation startups and how they all come together. 



"Building the Future: How Lego, Citizen Participation, and Innovation Startups are Changing the Game"

When we think of innovation, we often think of tech giants and R&D labs. But what if I told you that the key to unlocking the next big breakthrough lies in the collective creativity of everyday people?

Lego, the beloved toy company, has been at the forefront of this movement for years. They have successfully crowdsourced ideas from their passionate fanbase through the Lego Ideas platform, bringing fan-designed sets such as the NASA Apollo Saturn V and the Women of NASA to store shelves.

"The Open Innovation Advantage", a study found by deloitte found that companies using open innovation generated an average of 30% more revenue from their new products and services than companies that did not use open innovation.

And it's not just about bringing cool new products to market. These platforms are also being used to tackle social and environmental issues through design thinking.

But Lego isn't the only one tapping into the power of citizen participation.

1.  Kickstarter: This platform allows creators to share their ideas and projects with the public, and raise funds from backers to bring them to life.
2.  GitHub: This platform is a development platform and collaboration tool for developers to share and work on code.

However, it's also important to note that citizen participation alone is not a guarantee of success. The quality of citizen engagement, the level of transparency and accountability, and the ability of government officials to effectively incorporate citizen feedback are all important factors that can impact the success of a project.

We, Nelleke de Boer and Christiaan Verhoef also have expierance with these types of innovation.

But seeing also many failures and frustrations with these programs, makes us think there is more to it.

Idea crowdsourcing is a part of Chesbrough’s Open Innovation Paradigm. This paradigm assumes that organizations should use ideas from external stakeholders to innovate (Chesbrough 2011). Open innovation is an approach which describes an attempt to merge knowledge from different contributing stakeholders to develop and exploit innovation (Ahn et al. 2019). 

One of the problems with crowdsourcing for ideas are information overflow and the poor quality of submissions (Westerski and Kanagasabai 2019). 

The rationale for relying on crowdsourcing is that a diverse community will develop fundamentally different innovations compared to internal staff of professional inventors. This community will draw from a different knowledge base, context, product usage, discipline or specialty work areas (Hippel, 2005; Schenk & Guittard, 2011)

Therefor we (Nelleke and Chris) think it is necessary to research characteristics that can influence quality. 

Open innovation can be an appealing option if companies face the following issues:

**Inflexibility**  
Many large companies have been built on a solid foundation. There are departments that coordinate with one another and assume responsibility for different aspects of the business. They have specific expertise and knowledge for the industry they are working in and assume complete responsibility for creation, production, and sales. Each group has domain knowledge that could be applied, but other priorities take precedence which leads to my next point. 

**Role Definition**  
Middle management’s job is to ensure employees have clear roles and responsibilities that they are expected to fulfill. Motivating factors for employees are bonuses, raises, and promotions. These motivations aren’t always in line with taking on a projects that have a high probability of failure (innovation is difficult).  This is why people often don’t take the initiative to go beyond their job descriptions for these types of projects.

**Burnout**  
There will always come a time when designers and innovators will reach a point of burnout after being pushed time and time again. This inability to come up with new ideas, upgrades, or enhancements can often create a backlog in the company.

## **How can crowdsourced innovations help?**

There is a reason why many big companies like NASA opt for open innovation; it is highly beneficial and useful. By leveraging open innovation marketplaces, you will be able to achieve the following benefits:

**True Feedback**  
The reality is, crowds that are involved in open innovation challenges don’t have the same responsibilities to the organization hosting the challenge. That means they wont suffer any consequences for submitting a design that isn’t ideal. Similarly, they will also not be shy about feedback since they are the end receivers of the product or service. This means you can get a range of different ideas that can help your organization solve a problem, or propose a new product/service. 

**Newer Perspectives**  
When you engage crowds, you will be exposed to a diverse range of ideas, suggestions, and perspectives. Concepts like burnout are quickly resolved when you are feeding off the energy and innovation of others. This newer perspective is something that can be explosive for your company. The best part is that you can choose from a vast pool of ideas and perspectives.

Brands are using crowdsourcing to generate new ideas with the help of their customers and their “collective intelligence” or “wisdom of the crowd” (Piller, 2008; Xu, Ribeiro-Soriano, & Gonzalez-Garcia, 2015). Zhao (2019) defined crowdsourcing as making “use of individuals to get innovative solutions through an open call and transforms the innovative potential of a crowd in an organized and durable community” (p. 3)

The rationale for relying on crowdsourcing is that a diverse community will develop fundamentally different innovations compared to internal staff of professional inventors. This community will draw from a different knowledge base, context, product usage, discipline or specialty work areas (Hippel, 2005; Schenk & Guittard, 2011)

**Can it go wrong?**

Oh very, One example of a major disaster from open source innovation is the failure of the "Project Ara" which was a modular smartphone project by Google. The project was based on the idea of creating a phone where users could customize and upgrade individual components such as the camera, battery, and processor.

The project was first announced in 2013 and was expected to launch in 2015, but it was officially cancelled in 2016. Google invested over $50 million in the project, but it was not able to overcome the technical and commercial challenges that came with creating a modular smartphone. The project faced difficulties in creating a modular design that was both functional and affordable.

Another example of a major disaster from open innovation is the failure of the "KodakCoin" project by Kodak. Kodak, the iconic photography company, announced in 2018 the creation of its own cryptocurrency, the KodakCoin, and a blockchain-based platform called KodakOne, with the purpose of creating a decentralized digital rights management system to protect photographers' rights and help them receive fair compensation for the use of their work.

The project was met with skepticism and criticism by experts, who pointed out that Kodak had no experience or expertise in blockchain technology or cryptocurrency. Additionally, the project faced legal problems and regulatory hurdles. Kodak was also criticized for using the hype around blockchain technology to inflate its stock price.

The project failed to gain traction, and Kodak was forced to abandon it. The company's stock price tumbled, and Kodak was left with a tarnished reputation and a significant loss of resources and money invested in the project.

**So open innovation is not all that it lives out to be?**

You know this if you have participated in these programs, the outset is all sunshine and rainbows, but followup can be lacking, a real commitment, or simply not the right people makes these projects fail often, or even fail to start. 

A study by the European Commission found that only 29% of companies surveyed reported that they had successfully commercialized an idea from external sources, while 32% of companies reported that they had not been able to commercialize any ideas from external sources.

One of the major downsides of open innovation is that it can be difficult to manage and control. With open innovation, companies are opening up their innovation processes to external parties, which can increase the risk of intellectual property theft, legal disputes, and other issues. Additionally, companies may struggle to effectively manage and integrate the influx of new ideas and technologies that come from external sources.

Open Innovation can be Costly: Companies may need to invest in new technology, resources, and personnel to effectively manage open innovation processes. Additionally, companies may need to spend money on external partners and collaborators, such as licensing fees or research and development costs.

Information overflow
Too many ideas can lead to information overflow (Westerski & Kanagasabai, 2019). This problem is called ‘crowding’ (Piezunka & Dahlander, 2015). In order to reduce ‘crowding’ researchers are interested in understanding which ideators (i.e., those who are sending their ideas) (Bogers et al., 2017; Mack & Landau, 2020) and idea characters have a positive effect on the quality of the submissions. Previous research suggests that successful ideators and ideas possess certain characteristics (Bagheri et al., 2020; Pollok, Lüttgens, & Piller, 2019; Schmidthuber, Piller, Bogers, & Hilgers, 2019)

careful planning, execution, and risk management, as shown by google's Ara failure can influance these projects too; Often these innovation have a lot of ambition and energy at the start, but when followtrough is lacking, due to lack of funding, administration or risk management it often goes wrong. 

A major failure of open innovation can be a lack of participation from external partners, this can be due to a lack of trust and perception that the company is not open to new ideas or not willing to share the benefits that come with it.

Another failure of open innovation can be poor communication and coordination between internal and external partners, this can lead to delays, misunderstandings and ultimately, the failure of the project.

Furthermore, a study by PwC found that while 84% of companies surveyed believed that open innovation was important to their business, only 14% had fully implemented open innovation strategies.

**Disasters, disasters everywhere**

One example of a major disaster from open source innovation is the failure of the "Project Ara" which was a modular smartphone project by Google. The project was based on the idea of creating a phone where users could customize and upgrade individual components such as the camera, battery, and processor.

The project was first announced in 2013 and was expected to launch in 2015, but it was officially cancelled in 2016. Google invested over $50 million in the project, but it was not able to overcome the technical and commercial challenges that came with creating a modular smartphone. The project faced difficulties in creating a modular design that was both functional and affordable.

The project was seen as a failure for Google, and it was a significant loss of the money invested in it. It also had a negative impact on the reputation of the company as it was seen as unable to successfully execute an open-source innovation project.

**So how can you make open innovation successful?**

Successfull ideator checklist;
The more active an ideator is (by leaving comments on other ideas and by posting ideas themselves) the greater the chance that his / her ideas will be further developed If other ideators express that an idea is innovative in the comments, this also has a positive effect on the chance that an idea will be implemented. When other ideators express in their comments that they think it's a good idea, it also leads to companies implementing an idea faster.
