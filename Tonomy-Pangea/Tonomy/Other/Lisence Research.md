Stallman built the GNU operating system with the above freedoms — and the concept of copyleft — in mind. The “What is Copyleft?” page of GNU.org explains copyleft with regard to software in these terms:

> “To copyleft a program, we first state that it is copyrighted; then we add distribution terms, which are a legal instrument that gives everyone the rights to use, modify, and redistribute the program's code, or any program derived from it, but only if the distribution terms are unchanged. Thus, the code and the freedoms become legally inseparable.

> “Proprietary software developers use copyright to take away the users’ freedom; we use copyright to guarantee their freedom. That’s why we reverse the name, changing “copyright” into “copyleft.” ([GNU.org, “What is Copyleft?”](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html)

As its name implies, the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) is part of the GNU GPL family, which also includes the [LGPL License](https://fossa.com/blog/open-source-software-licenses-101-lgpl-license/), [GPL v2](https://fossa.com/blog/open-source-software-licenses-101-gpl-v2/), and [GPL v3](https://fossa.com/blog/open-source-software-licenses-101-gpl-v3/). All of these [open source licenses](https://fossa.com/blog/what-do-open-source-licenses-even-mean/) are part of Richard Stallman’s GNU Project, a free and open source operating system and accompanying philosophy regarding the sharing and modification of software.

Generally require that any derivative work of the copyleft-licensed software be released under the same license as the original software. In other words, the modified code has to be exactly as “open” as the original. One of the practical ramifications of this requirement is that OSS users may be forced to publish their own changes or additions in source code form if they release a binary that includes a copyleft-licensed component.

Copyleft licenses stand in contrast to [permissive licenses](https://fossa.com/blog/all-about-permissive-licenses/), which tend to have few restrictions on use of the licensed code. They also don’t have any such code-sharing requirement, so the “open source-ness” does not necessarily persist to the derivative work. That is a feature or a bug, depending on how you look at it. For developers of proprietary software, software under copyleft licenses must be used with care. For developers of free and open source software, copyleft is a way to ensure the software remains freely available.

The idea behind the AGPL License was to address the “[application service provider (ASP) loophole](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/gnu-affero-general-public-license),” which both Henry Poole and Stallman believed existed in the GPL. The ASP loophole meant that software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers and other software that ran primarily over a network were exempt (or could potentially argue exemption) from the terms of the GPL license. This is because they didn’t technically “distribute” it in the traditional sense.

To close this loophole, the GNU AGPL makes it clear that network use counts as distribution of the software. Specifically
