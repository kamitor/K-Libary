First Impressions


**While the website looks highly professional, as an individual who does not understand tech and identifications very well, the value is not clear at all**. I have no idea what is actually different here than with other identification systems. You mention a lot of fancy words, and really cool ideas for the future. However, most of this is barely related to the current product you are selling and only confuses me about what you are actually offering. I would completely prioritize your current product and frame the entire website, pricing and focus in this way. In general the style and language of your website and pitches seem very much in a tech related way. Instead of doing it your own way, I would adjust a little to the needs, preferences and style of your main customer group. Then you can actually inform them about the benefits they gain with you and onboard clients. 





Proposals:

- Call to action: **Join us, should not be the incentive**. As a company owner, I don’t want to join your discord. Instead offer companies a free initial consultation call.
[ agree ]

Let them sign up for a call and actually give them advice on their security and identity systems. After you offered them value, pitch them to join Tonomy and buy your services. 

Clearly showcase what’s different between Tonomy and other digital identification apps is. Clearly visualise that compared to traditional systems, where all the identification data is stored on one network, Tonomy stores the data on the individual user devices which makes it much more secure and private, and basically impossible to hack, while still offering the benefits of traditional identification systems. 

[ GDPR + Speed Calculation on the website]


- Demonstrate the problem that many companies in the industry are facing. Show numbers and facts that represent how many security systems get breached and how much of a loss it can cause for a company.

Statistics about the data

- Introduce a video into the website that showcases the value proposition and how people can easily integrate your technology



- Clearly frame your ideal customer groups for the product you are currently selling. Present the value proposition in a language and style that the customer is familiar with. 

- If your target audience is not highly tech educated, then cut out all the tech jargon and detailed complex explanation. Just because you use fancy words, doesn’t mean people will buy shit from you. Usually framing something in a simpler and more generic way gives way more leads. The tech jargon should be in there, but only in a “Find out how we do this” way for people who are interested in the tech details.

- Leave out all the future ideas and concepts. The DAO has nothing to do with your current product and is completely irrelevant to onboarding potential customers. If I, as an interested potential customer, go on the website, I wanna get the feeling that the product you are currently offering is your absolute priority and focus and that you are putting all your attention towards the service that I might buy. Mention Tonomy 2 and 3 only in the onboarding and investment section,. There it might proof of value to see your future goals. 

- The pricing plan is super weird. I have no idea what I get for my money. I would recommend to just skip the pricing, ask for a call and pitch the concept. Then you can then tailor your pricing based on the size and scale of the company and their needs. Also offer a free testing period. No-one will randomly pay hundreds or thousand of euros for months for a system that they didn’t test, especially if their entire company security depends on it. 



Thought on customer group and pitches: 

While supply chain might proof valuable customers in the future, I don’t think your current product offers the complexity that these companies require. After checking out systems that supply chains currently use, it becomes apparent that these softwares need a huge amount of additional features in a super easy interface for all their employees throughout all their ecosystems. Currently your product does not offer that. 

I would focus only on companies, where their customers need only one thing: a simple, private and not hackable way to identify themselves. 

Best target groups in my opinion: Educational systems.
Students always need an easy way to sign into systems. Universites are one of the most hacked organisations and data breaches can be extremely damaging for their reputation. On top of that universities often want to present themselves in a modern way and offer their students something new and cool. This might help selling the product. Also Chris, you already have a lot of connections in the field, so that will help. 

Other companies I would focus on is small - medium sized e-commerce businesses. Apparently these get hacked a lot and also they can promise their customers an additional layer of privacy, which might be an additional selling point for them. The only difficulty is that if I buy something online in a store, I don’t want to spend time downloading an app just to make the purchase. Therefore, for this customer group there should probably be a web version of your identification service, that can be super easy to access.


Perspective from Vlad

Main Problem ; I dont understand what tonomy is; It's cool, whitelabel; 
I am a person that runs a login system, I need this system, but this doesn't tell me this on the main website; 
Do you guys have a business plan; 
What is your solution exactly; 

So still goals; Multipule tools; 
Company stucture managed by Contracts;
Same goes for the respositories that you have; We have tonomy-ID this is a react native application.
They have their own fork; 
Issn't this redudant having an application for thus;
Vlad but google is more convient; and it's less convient; 
there its just a button; 
you cannot sell than that is less convient than google sso;
That would justify the additional time for this. 

You really need to show costumers what you are showing
Not just what you are and what you do;
Okay so you're tonomy - ID ;
Nothing that tells you how to intergrate it into a site
or what that would mean;

It's not easy to fix; you have to have this from the start or you will branch out that solve problems

>> What the is the problem that autonomy solves/
>> Need to check the problem exist; > Need to check what the market is in this > 







We send imagiges all the time;
each week we get 10 images from people
Sure there is a matter of privacy, people can even send naked pictures sometimes for us to the print

You have to educate your costumer about this; hey we use this increadble technology to use it it
THe more complicated it is, the more diffecult
Makes it more private, in the costumer Journey
They don't want to add complexity and add costumers for that;
I don't know if there is a way to solve this, but Im sure there are.
I think there can be cool application; if someone send us an image they know it will only be stored for a week, then it will automatically get deleted from the server
The print the service > 
Especially if they send us art that they own, or they send us private images;
One Click, and they immediatly do it; 
One Click buying; > 


30 second video? 
if it becomes too abstract
I love fantasy and story
but a lot of bpeople are a more doubtful;
Plug the line 
Between nature
Terminalogy - and technology
