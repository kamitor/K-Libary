Example Game; 
The "Supply Chain Master" game is a virtual reality experience designed to help players master the key competencies of Supply Chain Management and Inventory Management. In this game, players take on the role of a supply chain manager, tasked with managing the flow of goods and materials within a virtual warehouse. Through a series of challenges and missions, players will learn how to make decisions on inventory levels, optimize stock levels, forecast demand, and minimize stock shortages and excess inventory.

In each level, players will encounter different scenarios that test their knowledge and skills in supply chain management, such as unexpected spikes in demand, production delays, and shipment cancellations. They will need to make quick and strategic decisions on how to manage these challenges, while balancing inventory costs and stock availability. The game will also introduce various tools and technologies used in real-world supply chain management, such as inventory management software, demand forecasting models, and safety stock calculators.

As players progress through the game, they will earn rewards and recognition for their achievements in supply chain and inventory management. The game will track their progress and provide feedback on their performance, helping them identify areas for improvement and reinforcing their learning. The ultimate goal of the game is to become a "Supply Chain Master," demonstrating mastery of all the key competencies in Supply Chain Management and Inventory Management.
