## List To do
## Next Steps According to Jimmy's Feedback

### Reevaluate the Vesting and Sales Strategy
- **Revise the Staggered Release Approach**: Consider reversing the current staggered approach to release tokens, as it may unintentionally create a pyramid scheme structure.
- [x] Define clear boundaries between public and private sales in your token distribution strategy.
- [x]  Schedule the public sale to occur simultaneously with or immediately after listing on exchanges to ensure transparency and fairness.
**Tokenomics**: Total Supply: 1 Billion ECT; 50% to environmental projects, 20% public sale, 15% team (vested over 2 years), 10% partners, 5% reserve. The token drives transactions for carbon credit trading, environmental impact funding, and community rewards.

### Public Sale and Exchange Strategy
- **Disassociate Public and Private Sales**: Ensure the public sale is distinct from the private sale, ideally happening simultaneously with the token's listing on exchanges.
- **Utilize Exchanges for Public Sale Role**: Leverage liquidity exchanges in decentralized exchanges (Dexes) as the medium for the public sale, treating the exchange activity as the public sale itself.
- [ ] Identify decentralized exchanges (Dexes) suitable for your token's public sale. 
- [ ] Negotiate terms with these exchanges to facilitate the public sale, focusing on liquidity and accessibility for potential investors.
- [ ] Find Standard Distribution Token Sheets to Compare
### Token Distribution and Market Impact
- **Reduce the Number of Rounds**: Minimize the rounds of private sales to prevent market fatigue and the dilution of token value.
- **Control Token Supply to the Public**: Aim to place a controlled number of tokens (42M mentioned) on Dexes, carefully managing the investment and sell-off dynamics to maintain token value.

### Reassess Tokenomics and Reward Strategy
- **Adjust Vesting Schedule**: Move the vesting schedule closer to the public sale to better align with market value realization.
- **Market Value vs. Dollar Value**: Shift focus from dollar-denominated rewards to token-based rewards, adapting the reward quantity as the token's market value changes.
- [x] Transition from dollar-denominated rewards to token-based rewards, adjusting the quantity of tokens given as rewards based on market value fluctuations. 
- [ ] Develop a clear policy for token rewards that outlines this approach, including scenarios for increases and decreases in token value.
### Legal and Financial Framework
- **Clarify Investment Nature**: Emphasize that the token sale is an investment, not a loan, to avoid misconceptions related to financial returns and obligations.
- [ ] Draft communications to investors and the public clarifying that the token sale is an investment opportunity, not a loan. 
- [ ] Ensure legal compliance in all jurisdictions where the token will be sold, highlighting the investment nature of the token sale.
### Operational Steps
1. **Collaborate with the Tokenomics Team**: To integrate Jimmy's feedback into the vesting and sales strategy, ensuring a sustainable and legally compliant approach.
2. **Communicate Changes to Stakeholders**: Inform all stakeholders, including marketing and legal teams, about the revised strategy to ensure alignment.
3. **Technical Implementation**: Adjust the token distribution mechanism on the platform to reflect the new strategy, ensuring technical feasibility and security.
4. **Market Analysis and Adjustment**: Continuously monitor the market response to the adjustments and remain flexible to further optimization based on real-time data and feedback.

### Monitoring and Feedback Loop
- **Establish a Feedback Mechanism**: Set up regular check-ins with Jimmy and other key stakeholders to review the impact of these changes and adjust strategies as necessary.




## Conversation Notes

### 14:05 - Private Sale Engagement and Vesting
- **For people engaging in the private sale**, everything is staggered; so the vesting, the sale start -> till month 12.
- **Note**: There is no public sale, only private.
- **Concerns**: Way too many rounds; there are so many people in the market that buy and sell private sale, leading to market fatigue. You're gonna run out of people pretty good.

### Agreement on Market Fatigue
- Totally agree with the above point.

### Public Sales Strategy
- **Column Point**: Instead of a public sale, your exchange acts like the public sale. Liquidity exchange in Dexes.
- **Tokens for Public**: 42M tokens are going to be placed in decentralized exchanges. This is what is going to the public.
- **Investment Detail**: They are going to invest 625 tokens at $0.002.
- **Risk**: People able to sell their tokens, 10 times more the supply that is available to the public at 20 times the profit. This includes marketing people given tokens for work, which is very risky.

### Chris | Tonomy Foundation - 02/27/2024 2:24 PM
- **Conclusion**: The staggered release of tokens creates a pyramid scheme. We should do the reverse. The public sale needs to be disconnected from the private sale. You want to do the public sale at the same time it's listed.
- **Note**: No 3 public sales; the moment is already done. When you can't undo a public sale, you can't control them anymore. You can do a private sale but have to lock their tokens till the public sale has participated for price discovery.

### Excel Sheet Formatting - Chris | Tonomy Foundation - 02/27/2024 2:31 PM
- **Important**: Nothing matters before the public sale, as that's the ONLY time tokens hit the market. Better to list them at the point that they will have MARKET value as that's the only moment when the Tokenomics actually come into play. Venting schedule literally means "being given to the people".

### Tokenomics Strategy - Chris | Tonomy Foundation - 02/27/2024 2:38 PM
- **Hack**: Based on the private sale, you can make an estimate. It's a small hack to have less tokens available so there are more buyers than sellers.

### Dollar Valuation and Rewards - Chris | Tonomy Foundation - 02/27/2024 2:47 PM
- **Issue with Dollar Devaluation**: If we denominate rewards in dollars, we risk not having enough tokens for rewards due to the hard cap. It's better to reward people in TOKENS and as the VALUE of tokens goes up, we give out LESS tokens.
- **Vesting Schedule Change**: In the vesting schedule, we will give tokens that have a SUGGESTED value but not a GUARANTEED value; to avoid the risk if the value drops.

### Investment vs. Loans
- Our vesting schedule, as well as the private sale, look like LOANS but they are NOT loans, they are investments. We need to stop calculating it back to dollars because it looks like I am going to give you X dollars to get XY dollars. Not, I am going to give you X dollars, to get Y tokens that could be worth XY dollars.
