5 weeks; 
The product is great but one thing i'm experiencing and the interns
we're messaging 100's of ppl and we're getting very little feedback compared it what we're supposed to be getting;
They get the message, they do the SSI management; but people don't understand why this is relevant to what we're doing.
Their is no way to do the urgency' : 
- analytics tool to look who is looking for SSI; 
Open Source Research;

Maybe need analytics tools; This person is at least looking for an SSI solution.
Sales Navigator. 

LinkedinHelper; 

Wall-ID: 
Decentralized Identity checkout.
Do they have funding maybe
Ozone - Meta-verse; 

Grilled on security  - Telecommunication; Jack said they used an algorithm. Triggered the shit out of them. The username and Password -> Try to get access by figuring out what the password part would be. Did you have any penetration setting; Also gave us the urgency on Security.


The right people to contact; We need to know who is in the market for shoes;

Targeting approach > Linkedin > Metrics > adding random people from all around the globe;

Next to the Business model
What problem we are solving
Integrate that more in our messaging;
Right now we're not really solving a problem that the other part of the market hasn't solved yet: Where is the institutional Gap:
It's nothing new; they have been able to do that with current market solution
What's new is the security; 
impressions I have: We have reached out a lot of people
Creating a single costumer seems quite difficult; 
We have to go figure out why:
People understand what we're doing. So what? How is this critical to my business; how is Octa.com ; how does this replace my Firebase; 
These questions are needed to be answered for the market to buy:

- Samin: He was supposed to take over the social media channels; but nothing yet;
- Danijel: Haven't' shown up;
- Binla: There every day;
- Eric: Was quite busy with grant proposal ++
- Hayk never seen again;
-
Figure out how to make the current guys more effective; THey are putting in the work but they are not getting anything out of it;
Only thing that comes to my mind is the tools at oracle and data-dog. 
Lead generation companies; Very expensive; 500 euro per meeting;

The one thing is still a problems;
Targeting of the accounts; 
List of companies or companies SSO SSI; 
Hard to formulate: 

One Pitch; Set a meeting with us; 
We created multiple pitches; One basic one that we're sending out; But still; Little to no responses. 
How do you can target that trough he masses;
