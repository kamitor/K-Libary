Obserable Key

sk-proj-k57pVCYb2hOAc4OssD11T3BlbkFJ47ZWFPznohL7gODo3KEF
Normal Key



Need to cheat for now I think;
Intergrate ChatGpt4 into Obserable directly, then move it with the Json Model;
Then afterwards I can try to move it to a local AI.


- [x] Add API Key to ObserableHQ to change the JSON  
	- [x] FAIL: Requires Credits and Credit Card; Don't have that.
- [x] Check Update on Local 
Success! Local updated to reflect online Changes.

Next up:  
Build File with Web based interface; 
Building on the excising file; 

Need to schedule Sprint Demo with Bart and Michiel, maxime etc.
