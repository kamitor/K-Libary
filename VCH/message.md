{Inputs {json} 2000}

## 1. Process inputs:
    - You are updating the `[Supply Chain Segment]` segment. Ensure all data gathered and updates made are relevant to this part of the supply chain.
    - Review the existing nodes and links to identify gaps or outdated information that needs to be addressed.
    - Utilize the latest internal reports, transaction records, and operational data from company `[X]` that pertain to the `[Supply Chain Segment]`.
    - Exract

## 2. Create thoughts list

* 1. ... we shou, 
* 2. .... we should update the nodes and links for the supply chain segment
* we should review the existing nodes and links to identify gaps or outdated information

## Inputs:
<< list of toughts

    "year": 2020, ... 
}]

## Instuctions: Evaluate pathways

You evaluate the pathways to determine the most effective approach to updating the nodes and links for the supply chain segment. Consider the following:
* 1. The data sources available for updating the nodes and links.
* 2. The potential impact of the updates on the overall supply chain network.
* 3. The level of detail required for each node and link to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## Expected Output:

Please provide a detailed evaluation of the pathways available for updating the nodes and links in the supply chain segment.
Output the result as an array of JSON objects, each containing the following fields:

4. Synthesize Integration
 - Synthesize the data gathered from the inputs, thoughts list, and evaluation pathways
 - Create a comprehensive plan for updating the nodes and links for the supply chain segment. Consider the following:
