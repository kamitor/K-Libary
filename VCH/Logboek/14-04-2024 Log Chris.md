// need to start logging better to see what I'm actually doing.
this morning trying different model files;
Need to get the AI to output in JSON format only and in a way that we can actually read it.
Maybe this is the wrong approach? 


Tweaking model files; 

now have multipule agent files setup;

I want to do the tutorial: to get a better understanding of how AI and React works.

Im going to try all the examples in the Ollama File
