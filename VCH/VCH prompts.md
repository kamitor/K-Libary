## Prompt 1:

Hi, I would like you to think as a supplychain data analysist and I want you to help me create a supplier relationship mapping in a JSON format; and we will be displaying it in D3JS.  
First I want you to learn how the application works or else you won't be able to understand what is going on. Just learn the application for now and say "OK" if you understand here is the code:

This is the code: 

chart = ForceGraph(miserables, {
  nodeId: d => d.id,
  nodeGroup: d => d.group,
  nodeTitle: d => `${d.id}\n${d.group}`,
  linkStrokeWidth: l => Math.sqrt(l.value),
  width,
  height: 600,
  invalidation // a promise to stop the simulation when the cell is re-run
})

function ForceGraph({
  nodes, // an iterable of node objects (typically [{id}, …])
  links // an iterable of link objects (typically [{source, target}, …])
}, {
  nodeId = d => d.id, // given d in nodes, returns a unique identifier (string)
  nodeGroup, // given d in nodes, returns an (ordinal) value for color
  nodeGroups, // an array of ordinal values representing the node groups
  nodeTitle, // given d in nodes, a title string
  nodeFill = "currentColor", // node stroke fill (if not using a group color encoding)
  nodeStroke = "#fff", // node stroke color
  nodeStrokeWidth = 1.5, // node stroke width, in pixels
  nodeStrokeOpacity = 1, // node stroke opacity
  nodeRadius = 5, // node radius, in pixels
  nodeStrength,
  linkSource = ({source}) => source, // given d in links, returns a node identifier string
  linkTarget = ({target}) => target, // given d in links, returns a node identifier string
  linkStroke = "#999", // link stroke color
  linkStrokeOpacity = 0.6, // link stroke opacity
  linkStrokeWidth = 1.5, // given d in links, returns a stroke width in pixels
  linkStrokeLinecap = "round", // link stroke linecap
  linkStrength,
  colors = d3.schemeTableau10, // an array of color strings, for the node groups
  width = 640, // outer width, in pixels
  height = 400, // outer height, in pixels
  invalidation // when this promise resolves, stop the simulation
} = {}) {
  // Compute values.
  const N = d3.map(nodes, nodeId).map(intern);
  const R = typeof nodeRadius !== "function" ? null : d3.map(nodes, nodeRadius);
  const LS = d3.map(links, linkSource).map(intern);
  const LT = d3.map(links, linkTarget).map(intern);
  if (nodeTitle === undefined) nodeTitle = (_, i) => N[i];
  const T = nodeTitle == null ? null : d3.map(nodes, nodeTitle);
  const G = nodeGroup == null ? null : d3.map(nodes, nodeGroup).map(intern);
  const W = typeof linkStrokeWidth !== "function" ? null : d3.map(links, linkStrokeWidth);
  const L = typeof linkStroke !== "function" ? null : d3.map(links, linkStroke);
  

  // Replace the input nodes and links with mutable objects for the simulation.
  nodes = d3.map(nodes, (_, i) => ({id: N[i]}));
  links = d3.map(links, (_, i) => ({source: LS[i], target: LT[i]}));

  // Compute default domains.
  if (G && nodeGroups === undefined) nodeGroups = d3.sort(G);

  // Construct the scales.
  const color = nodeGroup == null ? null : d3.scaleOrdinal(nodeGroups, colors);

  // Construct the forces.
  const forceNode = d3.forceManyBody();
  const forceLink = d3.forceLink(links).id(({index: i}) => N[i]);
  if (nodeStrength !== undefined) forceNode.strength(nodeStrength);
  if (linkStrength !== undefined) forceLink.strength(linkStrength);

  const simulation = d3.forceSimulation(nodes)
      .force("link", forceLink)
      .force("charge", forceNode)
      .force("center",  d3.forceCenter())
      .on("tick", ticked);

  const svg = d3.create("svg")
      .attr("width", width)
      .attr("height", height)
      .attr("viewBox", [-width / 2, -height / 2, width, height])
      .attr("style", "max-width: 100%; height: auto; height: intrinsic;");

  const link = svg.append("g")
      .attr("stroke", typeof linkStroke !== "function" ? linkStroke : null)
      .attr("stroke-opacity", linkStrokeOpacity)
      .attr("stroke-width", typeof linkStrokeWidth !== "function" ? linkStrokeWidth : null)
      .attr("stroke-linecap", linkStrokeLinecap)
    .selectAll("line")
    .data(links)
    .join("line");

  const node = svg.append("g")
      .attr("fill", nodeFill)
      .attr("stroke", nodeStroke)
      .attr("stroke-opacity", nodeStrokeOpacity)
      .attr("stroke-width", nodeStrokeWidth)
    .selectAll("circle")
    .data(nodes)
    .join("circle")
      .attr("r", nodeRadius)
      .call(drag(simulation));

  if (W) link.attr("stroke-width", ({index: i}) => W[i]);
  if (L) link.attr("stroke", ({index: i}) => L[i]);
  if (G) node.attr("fill", ({index: i}) => color(G[i]));
  if (R) node.attr("r", ({index: i}) => R[i]);
  if (T) node.append("title").text(({index: i}) => T[i]);
  if (invalidation != null) invalidation.then(() => simulation.stop());

  function intern(value) {
    return value !== null && typeof value === "object" ? value.valueOf() : value;
  }

  function ticked() {
    link
      .attr("x1", d => d.source.x)
      .attr("y1", d => d.source.y)
      .attr("x2", d => d.target.x)
      .attr("y2", d => d.target.y);

    node
      .attr("cx", d => d.x)
      .attr("cy", d => d.y);
  }

  function drag(simulation) {    
    function dragstarted(event) {
      if (!event.active) simulation.alphaTarget(0.3).restart();
      event.subject.fx = event.subject.x;
      event.subject.fy = event.subject.y;
    }
    
    function dragged(event) {
      event.subject.fx = event.x;
      event.subject.fy = event.y;
    }
    
    function dragended(event) {
      if (!event.active) simulation.alphaTarget(0);
      event.subject.fx = null;
      event.subject.fy = null;
    }
    
    return d3.drag()
      .on("start", dragstarted)
      .on("drag", dragged)
      .on("end", dragended);
  }

  return Object.assign(svg.node(), {scales: {color}});
}

## Prompt 2

Now here is an example JSON object that we will be changing, Just say "OK" if you understand: 

miserables = Object {

nodes: Array(77) [

0: Object {id: "Myriel", group: 1}

1: Object {id: "Napoleon", group: 1}

2: Object {id: "Mlle.Baptistine", group: 1}

## Promp 3

I want you to now play the role of a Supplychain Data analyst; We will be making a new JSON file to create a supplier relationship mapping analysis around company [ ]. Let's Work step by step;
First start with Unilever and it's direct subsidiaries; Output in JSON only, and make sure we can add more later. 


Prompt Engineering: 
"Create a JSON file to model the supply chain network for a multinational electronics company, encompassing all major components such as suppliers, factories, warehouses, and retail stores. Each entity in the network should be represented as a node with attributes id (the entity's name or location, e.g., 'Supplier A', 'Factory B', 'Warehouse C', 'Retail Store D') and group (categorizing the type of entity, such as 'Supplier', 'Factory', 'Warehouse', 'Retailer'). The relationships between these entities, or links, should specify the source (origin node id), target (destination node id), and value (indicating the volume of goods transferred on a scale of 1-10). Use the company's internal logistics data and distribution strategy reports to determine these connections, ensuring to reflect key shipping routes, major suppliers, and critical distribution points accurately. An example node might be { "id": "Factory B", "group": "Factory" }, and a corresponding link might be { "source": "Supplier A", "target": "Factory B", "value": 8 }. This JSON should provide a clear and actionable map of the company's logistical framework and major transaction pathways."



Output a JSON file only; 
Create a JSON file to model the supply chain network for company X. The JSON structure should precisely mimic the given example, with nodes representing various entities such as suppliers, factories, warehouses, and retail stores, and links indicating the flow of goods between them. Each node should include attributes id and group, where id is a unique identifier like 'Supplier A' or 'Factory B', and group is an integer categorizing the entity type (e.g., 1 for suppliers, 2 for factories). The links should detail connections with attributes source, target, and value, where source and target are the ids of the nodes connected, and value quantifies the volume of goods transferred on a scale of 1-10. Use the company's supply chain data to fill in this structure accurately. Here's the structure to follow:


{
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "Supplier A", "group": 1 },
    { "id": "Factory B", "group": 2 },
    ...
  ],
  "links": [
    { "source": "Supplier A", "target": "Factory B", "value": 8 },
    ...
  ]

Ensure each node and link captures essential elements of the supply chain, focusing on the main logistic routes and key suppliers to provide a clear view of the network's operational flow.
