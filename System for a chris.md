# Daily Planing

[[To do list]]


## Based On Eisenhower Urgency System 

### To-Do's on a Daily Basis 
- Implementing the Eisenhower system, categorise your tasks into the following sections: 
  1. **Important and Urgent** - Tasks that must be done immediately. 
  2. **Important but not Urgent** - Tasks that are important but can be scheduled to do later.
  3. **Not Important but Urgent** - Tasks that can be delegated.
  4. **Not Important and Not Urgent** - Tasks that you can erase.
