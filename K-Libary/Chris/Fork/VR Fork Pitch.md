I. Why:

-   The purpose of the VR environment is to provide an immersive and interactive experience for users to learn, see use-cases, ideate and train in the benefits and implementation of the Open Food Chain's decentralized food supply chain solution.

```
 Virtual reality (VR) technology has been used in the agri-food industry for several purposes, including:

1.  Training: VR can be used to provide immersive training experiences for workers in the agri-food industry, such as for operating equipment or handling food safely.

	Example: A VR training program for food safety could simulate various scenarios, such as handling contaminated food, to help workers understand the importance of proper food handling techniques.
	
2.  Product demonstrations: VR can be used to showcase products in a more engaging and interactive way, such as for showing how food is grown or processed.
    Example: A VR product demonstration for a new type of fruit could allow customers to see how the fruit is grown, harvested, and processed, helping to increase customer understanding and appreciation for the product.
3.  Research and development: VR can be used to test and develop new products and techniques in a simulated environment, such as for studying the growth of crops in different conditions.
    Example: A VR research and development program for a new type of fertilizer could simulate the growth of crops in various conditions to determine the best conditions for using the fertilizer.
4.  Marketing and sales: VR can be used to provide a unique and memorable experience for customers, such as for showcasing the origin and quality of food products.
	Example: A VR marketing campaign for a new brand of olive oil could allow customers to see the process of growing and harvesting the olives, helping to increase customer trust and loyalty to the brand.


Here are some statistics about virtual reality (VR) as of 2021:

-   Market size: The global virtual reality market size is expected to reach $44.7 billion by 2024, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30.8% from 2020 to 2024.
    
-   Gaming industry: In the gaming industry, VR is expected to generate $45.2 billion in revenue by 2027, with the majority of the revenue coming from hardware sales.
    
-   Healthcare industry: In the healthcare industry, the use of VR for therapy and training is expected to reach $3.8 billion by 2025.
    
-   Education sector: In the education sector, the use of VR for training and simulation is expected to reach $700 million by 2025.
    
-   Adoption rate: The adoption rate of VR is expected to increase significantly over the next few years, with approximately 171 million VR devices expected to be in use by 2025.

II. How:

-   Utilize VR technology to create a virtual world where users can interact with the different elements of the food supply chain and understand how the Open Food Chain solves common problems in the traditional food industry.
-   Incorporate real-life scenarios and data to educate users on the advantages of the Open Food Chain's solution, such as increased transparency and efficiency.

III. What:

-   Develop a VR environment that accurately represents the food supply chain and the role of the Open Food Chain in improving it.
-   Create a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the VR environment, learn about the different elements of the food supply chain, and understand the benefits of the Open Food Chain's solution.
-   Test and refine the VR environment to ensure it accurately conveys the benefits of the Open Food Chain and provides a positive user experience.
-   Launch and promote the VR environment to educate and engage potential users, customers, and partners about the Open Food Chain.

This plan can serve as a starting point for implementing the VR environment for The Open Food Chain. Based on the specific needs and goals of the startup, further details and steps may need to be added or adjusted.

Create an agile user story for playing a scrum - agile game Include a definition of done

Agile User Story:

As a Scrum team member, I want to be able to play a Scrum-Agile game, so that I can learn and practice Scrum principles and values in a fun and interactive way.

Definition of Done:

-   The game is developed and deployed on a platform accessible to all team members.
-   The game accurately reflects Scrum principles and values, such as sprints, daily stand-up meetings, product backlog, and retrospectives.
-   The game allows for team collaboration and competition.
-   The game provides feedback and reinforcement for the players' understanding and application of Scrum principles and values.
-   The game is thoroughly tested and free of bugs or technical issues.

This Agile User Story can be used to guide the development of the Scrum-Agile game and ensure that the end product meets the desired goals and expectations of the Scrum team.
