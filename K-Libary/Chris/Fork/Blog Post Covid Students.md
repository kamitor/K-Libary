The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on education, or so it looks like, seeing my recent encounters with new students as interns within the Tonomy Foundation, with schools and universities shutting down and transitioning to online learning. One of the biggest challenges that educators have faced is dealing with slow-performing students in this new environment, and it's showing the performance of interns that we've had. 

Slow-performing students are those who struggle to keep up with their peers in terms of academic progress and work output. They struggle to learn new things or pick up things rapidly, perferring to wait and see until someone intervenes. 

The transition to online learning has made it even more challenging for slow-performing students to succeed. Without the structure and support of a traditional classroom, these students may struggle to stay on task and motivated. They may also struggle to understand the material without the guidance of a teacher or the support of their classmates.

To support slow-performing students during this difficult time, educators need to be proactive and intentional in their approach. Here are a few strategies that can help:

1.  Provide additional support: Slow-performing students may need extra help to understand the material, so it's important to provide additional support in the form of one-on-one tutoring, small group instruction, or online resources.
    
2.  Be flexible and patient: Slow-performing students may struggle with the pace of online learning, so it's important to be flexible and patient with them. Allow them to work at their own pace and provide extra time for them to complete assignments.
    
3.  Communicate regularly: Regular communication with parents and guardians can help to ensure that slow-performing students are getting the support they need at home. Keep them informed of their child's progress and provide suggestions for how they can help at home.
    
4.  Keep expectations realistic: Slow-performing students may not be able to perform at the same level as their peers, so it's important to keep expectations realistic. Be understanding and patient with them, and celebrate their successes, no matter how small.
    

In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges for slow-performing students, but with the right strategies in place, educators can help these students to succeed. By providing additional support, being flexible and patient, communicating regularly, and keeping expectations realistic, educators can help slow-performing students to navigate this difficult time and achieve their full potential.
