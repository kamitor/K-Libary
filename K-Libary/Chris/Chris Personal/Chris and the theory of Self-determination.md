1.  Autonomy: The need to feel in control of one's own life and choices, and to feel like one's actions are self-determined rather than imposed by others.
    
2.  Competence: The need to feel effective and capable in one's own pursuits, and to feel like one is making progress toward meaningful goals.
    
3.  Relatedness: The need to feel connected to others and to be a part of a community or social network.
    

Chris, feels sense of disconnection or lack of belonging because his basic needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are not being met in certain situations or relationships. For example, Chris is crossing people's boundaries or being accused of manipulation, this is a sign that the autonomy is not being met. He feels that he doesnt have control his own actions or that others are imposing their will on you.

He feels he repeatedly loses the trust of people around you, which could be a sign that your need for relatedness is not being met. You may feel disconnected from others or like you are not part of a supportive community.

What is chris afraid of

What would you be like if you stopped doing what you know is bad for you
What would you be, if you would be you know you could be

It's normal to be afraid, it's not normal to do nothing;
You should despense with the idea of that you can sustain yourself forever.
If you don't change, time will keep on ticking; You will have the same problems, but then you're older, less able to change.

Maybe you need to educate yourself more, maybe you need to sharpen your social skills. 

Imagine if you were taking care of yourself
If you could get everything what you want 
How would you educate yourself
How would you arrage yourself

Treat yourself with care; Like you're someone that you care about; 
How would you like to be treated? Do you want to be nice to you? How does discipline look like

People often treat others better than themselves; there is a 30 % that you don't even pick up your perscription; Why don't you do it for yourself?
You make the world a worse place if you don't take care of yourself.

Knowing what you want, is half the success;
Why? 

You are not who you think you're think that you are;
How many hours do you waiste
ineffecient studying
Youtube abuse
What is chris's hour'ly rate?
What would happen if you stopped waisting the opportunities that are standing infront of you?

Don't stand still: 
It's easy to fall back in old habits
It's about small slow habits getting implemented; 

Resentfullness;
I've noticed this pattern of interaction this is making me feel X  
Danger is taking it out on your partner; passive aggressiveness
You can't just say what's wrong - Can't just complain
What would by minimum values or precondisions for satisfaction be? 

All the answers are in your end

What remarkably stupid things am I doing that are ruening my life;

- Im avoid conflict with my partner in order 

Do you have anything better to do with you life than executing this self improvement program?


By understanding the basic needs outlined in the theory of self-determination, you may be able to identify areas where you are not feeling fulfilled or motivated, and work to address these needs in your life. This could involve seeking out more supportive relationships or environments, focusing on developing your own competencies and strengths, or finding ways to exercise greater autonomy in your choices and actions.


Autonomy:

To satisfy the need for autonomy, individuals should be encouraged to pursue their own goals and make choices that are consistent with their values and interests. This could involve seeking out opportunities for self-expression and creativity, setting personal boundaries with others, and finding ways to exercise control over their own lives. It's important to note that autonomy does not necessarily mean independence or isolation, but rather a sense of being able to act in accordance with one's own needs and desires.

Competence:

To satisfy the need for competence, individuals should be encouraged to develop their own skills and competencies, and to pursue goals that are challenging but attainable. This could involve seeking out opportunities for learning and growth, setting achievable goals and tracking progress, and finding ways to build on existing strengths and talents. It's important to note that competence is not just about achieving external success or recognition, but also about feeling a sense of mastery and efficacy in one's own pursuits.

Relatedness:

To satisfy the need for relatedness, individuals should be encouraged to seek out meaningful connections with others, and to be part of supportive communities or social networks. This could involve seeking out opportunities for social interaction and collaboration, building positive relationships with others, and finding ways to contribute to the well-being of others. It's important to note that relatedness is not just about socializing or being liked by others, but also about feeling a sense of belonging and connection to something larger than oneself.


Self-determination theory proposes that individuals experience different stages of self-determination, which are as follows:

1.  Amotivation: At this stage, individuals have no motivation or interest in a particular task or activity. They feel disconnected from the task and may not see any relevance or value in it.
    
2.  External regulation: At this stage, individuals are motivated by external factors such as rewards or punishments. They may engage in a task because they feel obligated or because they will receive some type of reward.
    
3.  Introjected regulation: At this stage, individuals have internalized the external factors and feel a sense of guilt or pressure to complete the task. They may feel like they "should" do something rather than actually wanting to do it.
    
4.  Identified regulation: At this stage, individuals have a clear understanding of why a task is important to them and have chosen to engage in it willingly. They may see the value or importance of the task and are motivated to complete it for personal reasons.
    
5.  Integrated regulation: At this stage, individuals have fully integrated the task or activity into their sense of self and values. They see the task as an expression of their identity and are highly motivated to engage in it.
    
6.  Intrinsic motivation: At this stage, individuals are motivated purely by the enjoyment and satisfaction they derive from the task or activity. They engage in the task for its own sake, rather than for any external reward or pressure.
Wat ik vooral ge

Wat zijn specifieke dingen die ik gedaan heb die jou beeld zo verander hebben over mij.

Je bent rustiger 
Je bent reseptiever -  Dat je doorvraagt bij mij; 

Als je samenwerking verband aan kan gaan, heb jij een compatibelheid proces aan te gaan, voordat jij het vertrouwen hebt omdaarmee kan omgaan.
Wat je vooral gedaan gedaan hebt; Dat je echt naar jezelf kan kijken
Aan het begin had je hiermee veel meer moeite

dan op het laast;
