The Beer Game is a simulation game that was developed to illustrate the challenges of managing a supply chain. It is a role-playing game that simulates the interactions and decisions made by the different players in a supply chain, such as retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers.

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton game that simulates the process of life, where players make decisions that affect their chances of survival and reproduction.  It can be set up using a grid of cells, where each cell can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The state of each cell in the next generation is determined by the state of the cells around it, following a set of rules.

To combine the two games, the Beer Game could be played on a board that is divided into cells, with each cell representing a different stage in the supply chain. The players would take on the roles of the different players in the supply chain and make decisions based on the information available to them. The Game of Life elements could be incorporated by adding a survival component to the game. For example, if a player makes a poor decision and their inventory runs out, they would lose a turn or even be eliminated from the game. Similarly, if a player's inventory grows too large, they would be penalized for waste.

Overall, by combining the Beer Game and the Game of Life, the simulation game will provide a more realistic representation of the challenges and dynamics of a supply chain and encourages players to think strategically and make smart decisions in order to survive and thrive in a competitive and uncertain environment.

Development:

1.  Study and Analysis (2 weeks)

-   Study the existing resources provided: [https://github.com/transentis/beergame](https://github.com/transentis/beergame) and [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/game-of-life-python-implementation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/game-of-life-python-implementation).
-   Understand the mechanics of the beer game and the Game of Life.
-   Identify the requirements of the new game and create a list of features.
-   Create a high-level design of the game architecture and data model. 

2.  Design and Development (8 weeks)

-   Design the game architecture and create a data model to represent the supply chain dynamics and the Game of Life.
-   Implement the game logic using Python, making use of any relevant libraries or frameworks.
-   Develop a user interface for the game, keeping in mind the user experience and the overall look and feel of the game.
-   Integrate the various components of the game and test them together.

3.  Testing and Deployment (4 weeks)

-   Test the game thoroughly to ensure that it is functioning correctly and that there are no bugs.
-   Deploy the game to a suitable platform, such as a website or an app store, for users to play.

4.  Maintenance and Improvement (ongoing)

-   Continuously monitor user feedback and implement new features and improvements.
-   Monitor the performance of the game and make necessary changes to optimize it.

Total Duration: 14 weeks or 560 hours for game development.
1.  Understand the mechanics of the beer game and the Game of Life. This will help in determining the requirements of the new game.

T Architecture:

1.  Backend:

-   Python to be used as the primary programming language for the backend of the game.
-   Flask, a micro web framework should be used to handle the server-side logic and routing of the game.
-   Database: MongoDB or MySQL can be used to store the game's data, as it's flexible and can handle large amounts of data.
-   Game Logic: The backend will handle the supply chain dynamics and the Game of Life logic, it will also handle the game's user authentication and authorization. We can use FLASK to make this happen. 

2.  Frontend:

-   ReactJS should be used as the frontend framework for the game, it's a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   Redux can be used for state management, it'll help in maintaining the state of the game in a centralized store.
-   Axios can be used for making API calls to the backend.

3.  Deployment:

-   The game can be deployed on a Linux server using a web server like with Nginx.
-   The game can be containerized using Docker, it'll help in easy deployment and scaling.
-   These can be monitored with portainer. 
-   The game's backend and frontend should be deployed separately, this will help in easy scaling and maintenance of the game.

4.  Continuous Integration and Deployment:

-   Git should be used as the version control system for the game's code.
-   Github Actions for CI

5.  Cloud Services:

-   Digital Ocean with Cloudflare

6.  APIs:

-   The game's backend can expose RESTful APIs that can be used by the frontend or any other client to interact with the game.
-   OpenAPI specification can be used to document the game's APIs.
