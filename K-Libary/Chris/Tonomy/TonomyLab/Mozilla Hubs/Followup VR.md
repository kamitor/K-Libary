I just finished taking part in my first virtual reality class this morning and it was an amazing experience! The class was focused on Blockchain and making quick pitches, and we got to do some hands-on presentations in the virtuality hub. I was a bit scared if everyone would be able to find their way or how to make sure everyone had their chance to present. The class was interactive and engaging, and I enjoyed the immersive experience. I am looking forward to more VR classes in the future. It is a great way to learn and explore new things in a more engaging way.
