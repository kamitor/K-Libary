Independent web 3.0 systems, such as the one developed by Tonomy foundation, that incorporate Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and Self-Sovereign Ownership (SSO) could potentially help the supply chain in several ways:

Firstly, SSI and SSO allow for decentralized and secure management of data, which can help to increase transparency and trust in the supply chain. By giving individuals and organizations control over their own data and identities, SSI and SSO can help to reduce the risk of data breaches and fraud, and make it easier to track and verify the identity of individuals and organizations in the supply chain.

Secondly, SSI and SSO can help to reduce the costs and complexity of managing supply chain data. By allowing individuals and organizations to manage their own data, SSI and SSO can help to eliminate the need for intermediaries and centralized systems, reducing the costs and complexity of managing data in the supply chain.

Thirdly, SSI and SSO can enable better management of provenance and traceability in the supply chain. By allowing individuals and organizations to share and verify information about the origin and history of goods, SSI and SSO can help to improve the traceability of goods and reduce the risk of fraud in the supply chain.

Lastly, the open-source and decentralized nature of web 3.0 systems can provide a level playing field for small and medium enterprises and farmers in the supply chain. SSO and SSI can enable them to assert their ownership and prove their authenticity, which can help them to access markets, and increase their bargaining power.

In summary, independent web 3.0 systems that incorporate SSI and SSO can potentially help the supply chain by increasing transparency, reducing costs and complexity, improving traceability and provenance, and providing equal opportunities for all stakeholders.
