One possible workshop format that can be used to identify problems within an organization and build a solution that meets those problems within an hour is a design thinking workshop. Here are some steps that can be followed:

1.  Define the problem: Start by identifying the problem that the organization is facing. Write it down in a clear and concise manner so that everyone can understand it.
    
2.  Empathize: In this step, try to understand the people who are affected by the problem. Ask questions such as: Who is impacted by this problem? What are their needs, fears, and motivations?
    
3.  Ideate: In this step, brainstorm as many ideas as possible to solve the problem. Encourage everyone to share their ideas, no matter how crazy they may seem.
    
4.  Prototype: Choose the best ideas from the ideation phase and create prototypes. These can be sketches, diagrams, or physical objects that represent the ideas.
    
5.  Test: Test the prototypes by gathering feedback from stakeholders. Use this feedback to refine the ideas and create a final solution.
    

This process can be completed in an hour by setting a strict time limit for each step and ensuring that everyone is actively engaged and contributing to the process.
