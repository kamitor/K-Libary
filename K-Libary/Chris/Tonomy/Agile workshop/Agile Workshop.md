## Tutorial

Requirements Game:
https://www.loom.com/share/1221b8bb8c6642cca4c6efad7b3731cb

PURPOSE:
----------------------------------------------
To See how quick interations will get you to a more accurate Project immediately. 
To map out requirements and to see how they can change as the result is shown.

Shows the 2 principles of 

Customer collaboration, over negotiation: HOW: Set the time that you think it should take at the start; During the sprint, make sure the house meets the definitions of done the costumer explained;

Responding to change over following a plan: At the start, make a basic plan of what you think the house should be.
Notice how far you came from the actual plan. 

You can have 2 modes: 
1 - Just the requirements game normal
Here is where you draw a product to get to the requirements as fast as possible.
2 - The requirements VS traditional approach
The traditional approach gives you the requirements at the start, you get more time, but you only get one chance.

Number of people per team: 1 - &

THE GOAL OF THE GAME:
----------------------------------------------
The Goal of the game is to get as close to the intended product that resides in the Product own'ers mind.



Each iteration last 5 minutes.

One fold at a time
1 minutes for planning,
2 minutes of actual build time,
1 minutes for review/retrospective – 

RULES FOR PLAYING THE GAME:


# Coin Game


https://www.loom.com/share/05ba92a85fc9406ebef118ac49ecffbc

INSTRUCTIONS


Roles:

4 People – “Workers” – Seated at the table

*4 People – “Managers” – Standing behind the Workers with stopwatches/cell phones* OPTIONAL

1 Person – Scribe/Facilitator – Writes down the times on the Flipchart & with a stopwatch/cell phone tracks how long it takes to process all the coins from start to finish

1 Person – Customer/Exec. – Has a stopwatch/cell phone tracking the time from the first coin from start to finish.


Setup:

Give the 20 coins to the first “worker” with all of the coins facing heads side up.

Setup the flip chart in a pace visible to all.


Objective:

To process the 20 coins through the system of workers as fast as possible.

To be processed, coins must be flipped(changed color/fill/background of the circles)– one at a time by the workes  – and then passed to the next worker in the chain who will do the same. Once the coins have been processed by all four workers, they are considered “done” with the round.

Workers may only pass the coins once the full batch of coins is complete.


Further instructions:

The managers of each worker will time how long it takes for their worker to process the 20 coins. Starting from when they pick the first one up and ending when they pass all coins to the next person.

The Scribe/Facilitator will also be timing how long it takes for the 20 coins to be processed completely

The Customer/Exec. will also be timing how long it takes for the first coin to be processed completely. In each, round, the facilitator will capture the time for each worker, the time for the first coin and the time for all 20 coins to be processed.


## House Game


https://www.loom.com/share/7669b7476f294c0e80e18fb4ebd7a741

PURPOSE:
----------------------------------------------
To demonstrate the power of time-box or Sprint that makes the heartbeat of an agile framework like Scrum.



How many can you build in three minutes?
Time Needed: 45 minutes

Number of people per team: 6

THE GOAL OF THE GAME:
----------------------------------------------
The goal of the game is for each team to create as much high quality houses that meet the demand of the stakeholders . 


Each iteration last 9 minutes.

Only one house can be completed at a time
2 minutes for planning,
3 minutes of actual build ( test included) time,
2 minutes for review/retrospective – 

RULES FOR PLAYING THE GAME:
Build as many houses as you can in a 3-minute time box.
One player can only Place one object at a time. That rules stays true for all three time-boxes.


Rules
----------------------------------------------
and tested in the 3-minute increment

Only houses that fit exactly on top of the model house will be counted
Each team should give a count of how many houses they are going to build before the time-box starts.
Subtract the final count of houses that actually flew from the planes that were built but were not tested or completed.  Eg: Team A said they will make 4 planes, 7 planes flew all the way but 5 were WIP ( work in progress). Subtract WIP so the actual is 7-5 =2
The team has to come up with one idea of improvement at the retrospective. Have one member in the team be the counter.


DEBRIEF: ( PICK ANY TWO )
Each table talks about what made them improve over the three iterations
Talk about what would have happened if the time box was not there
Talk about how waterfall may be different from this.
Talk about who made the final design decisions in the team.
Talk about any wastes they removed from the system that helped them get better.

Welcome to our online and digital Agile workshops! Our workshops are designed to help individuals become more autonomous in their work and personal life by using Agile methodology as a tool. We believe that Agile is not just a methodology, but a mindset that can help individuals and organizations become more responsive, flexible, and adaptable in today's fast-paced world.

Our workshops are conducted online, which means that anyone from anywhere in the world can participate. We have designed our workshops to be interactive and engaging, with a series of simulations and games that will help you understand the principles and practices of Agile. Our goal is not just to explain what Agile is, but also to help you understand why it works and how you can apply it to your work and personal life.

We understand that learning can be more effective when it is fun and engaging, which is why we have incorporated various simulations and games into our workshops. These activities are designed to help you experience the benefits of Agile first-hand and learn how to apply Agile principles and practices to your work and personal life.

We believe that autonomy is an important value for individuals and organizations, and our workshops are designed to help you become more autonomous by teaching you how to collaborate effectively, communicate clearly, and adapt to change. Our workshops are open to anyone who wants to learn and apply Agile principles and practices, regardless of their background, industry, or level of experience.

We look forward to seeing you at our upcoming workshops and helping you become more autonomous through the power of Agile methodology!

**Good**
 - Initiative to try to start this; You just went with what you got;
 - Examples were good; We need more change examples; One organisation is doing this, other organisations  
Bad
This, is  not a workshop, we're not doing work, we're listening to you present.
- The reason for the presentation and what to get out of this 
> Notes:
> 
> > Transparency > maybe best explained as protactive communication, and accountability. You are being Transparent about your process; you don't show everything;
> 
> Needs more Icebreakers; 
> > needs more interaction.

> question > did you get this presentation from somewhere else? 
> Want to change this combined with the games into a product that we can sell
