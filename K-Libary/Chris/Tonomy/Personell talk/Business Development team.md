## Why Business development

Business development is essential for any organization that wants to grow and expand. There are several reasons why a company should invest in business development, including:

1.  Increased revenue: By identifying new markets, customers, and opportunities for growth, business development can help increase revenue for the organization.
    
2.  Improved brand recognition: Developing new partnerships and relationships can help improve the organization's brand recognition and reputation in the industry.
    
3.  Competitive advantage: Business development can help the organization gain a competitive advantage by identifying unique market opportunities and developing strategies to capitalize on them.
    
4.  Diversification of revenue streams: By expanding into new markets and offering new products or services, business development can help diversify the organization's revenue streams, reducing the risk of relying on a single product or market.
    
5.  Innovation: Business development can help spur innovation within the organization by identifying new technologies, trends, and customer needs that can be leveraged to create new products or services.
    

Overall, business development is essential for any organization that wants to stay competitive, grow, and expand in the long term. It helps organizations identify new opportunities, develop strategies to capitalize on them, and stay ahead of the competition.

###  Busness development vs sales
Business development and sales are both important functions within an organization that are often closely related, but they have distinct differences.

Business development is the process of identifying new opportunities for growth and developing strategies to take advantage of them. Business development professionals work to establish new partnerships, identify new markets, and create new products or services that can help the organization grow and expand. Business development is typically focused on the long-term growth and sustainability of the organization.

On the other hand, sales are focused on generating revenue by selling products or services to customers. Sales professionals work to build relationships with customers, identify their needs, and offer solutions that meet those needs. Sales are typically focused on achieving short-term revenue targets and meeting the immediate needs of customers.

While business development and sales are both critical functions within an organization, they have different goals and objectives. Business development is focused on identifying new opportunities for growth and expanding the organization's reach, while sales are focused on generating revenue by selling products or services to customers. However, these functions are often closely related, and successful organizations need to have effective business development and sales strategies to achieve their goals.

#### example
A practical example of business development vs sales is as follows:

Suppose a company sells a software product that is popular among small businesses. The sales team is responsible for reaching out to potential customers, giving product demos, negotiating deals, and closing sales. They are primarily focused on selling the existing software product to customers to meet their immediate needs.

Meanwhile, the business development team is responsible for identifying new opportunities for growth and expansion. They may research the market and identify new customer segments, such as medium-sized businesses, that have different needs from the existing customer base. They may develop new features or products to meet these needs or explore partnerships with other companies to expand the software's reach. They are focused on developing new strategies and identifying new opportunities to grow the business in the long term.

In this example, the sales team is responsible for generating short-term revenue by selling the existing product, while the business development team is focused on identifying new opportunities and developing strategies to expand the company's reach in the long term. Both functions are critical for the success of the company, but they have different objectives and focus on different time horizons.
