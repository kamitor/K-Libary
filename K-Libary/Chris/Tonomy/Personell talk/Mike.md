How is it that you are feeling fucked?

Yesterday I understand whatever I do, it doesn't work; 
Spandanda They Do not come.
whatever you do, people still need money still need flow.

Just yesterday I got a message, ytgrash ; All those peopel
Yesterday I deleted them for 
Please can you tell me if you participating with Tonomy
If you give me a sub-contract > sorry buddy it doesn't work this way
If you order pina colada and you give me cold tea;

Hire people, When they come, they panic > How hard it was to come in. and to adapt
To go in slowly; We can handle it, they can't deal with it.
This is the checklist
We have a lot workshop .
I thought I done a good onboarding and they are frustrated, meaning those 6 months could have been more productive.

My friends one of them saying rest, 200 $ suits, drink beer, in the same time, I make 0 dollars, in 3 years if we are not succesful, thhose people will be hirer in their carreer, CFO COO, To find a job, a job in 3 years. 

50 %, let's put it this day, mvp, doesn't mean success
In the same time, go up in their carreer
How do you think that I should feel, look at our project; 
Understand the code; 
It's about endanger, Whatever I put in my mind. The workflow to hire people, the past interview, 30 mins, about our service, be as polite as possible, they don't care about the opporunity. 
Jack, you, I, People. 
Main problem.
