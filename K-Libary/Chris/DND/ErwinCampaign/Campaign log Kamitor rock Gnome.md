Draids are there, nothing of steel; 
They do not seem hostile;

I fire my gun into the air, the trees turn around, but the dryads don't respond

On the ground is a dagger, in red glow,
Both Rey and Eric || Go for new blade.

- New Session

Currently we are in a field of flowers, seems there is nothing going on.
Kass was lost for a bit and feels like she have been playing for very long. 

Olivia suggests that we might not be in the same time anymore.
We make our way back to the city, the roads are fully grown, the farmers are complexly surprised about the fields. 
In the far distance we can see the town, suddenly this really peacefull moment at the time, this aura overcomes you. You have these sinister feeling. 
We find a fully geared jester behind us, with red and back and has a opera face on him.
The clouwn introduces himself als Melden; 
The black ball turns out to be a dragon.
Malden stay 
Red Dragon. 
The City is burned down to a crisp as the dragon in the skies circles back; 
Any signs of organised defense?
Some guards are fighting back
A wizard shoots firebolts at it. 
Many people are focused at the dragon. 
Some wealthy person, is getting out of the cart. 
the dragon is flying over, 
There are people in the main street trying to get out of the town. 
How many people get out of the blast about 70%.
As rey throws his dagger and misses, and is blown off the wall;
As he tries to safe himself, he lands on his face; 
(takes 12 points of damage)

kamitor tries to rally the fleeing guards, tries to intimidate them, they fall to the ground in a fetal position.
Rey tries to do phychonic whispers to talk to the dragon.
The dragon says; This is the gods water, get out of the way.
Inside the city, kamitor is pushes to the grown. 
The guards are also getting pushes away.
Eric gives Kamitor to the coin to use.
The two faces, unhappyu and happy turn into one.
an immese aura; comes this same version of malden kamitor has seen in his dream, and steps out of this coin and jumps down.
Kamitor rolls a natural one, I the gun splits and and a large red beam goes into the sky as the dragon.
Goes ontop of the shiled, and flame. 
Eric thinks kamitor has dies and says Noooo kamitor.
A crow like figure is on top of him, to shield;
Feels the heat

Scape one if it's wings.
