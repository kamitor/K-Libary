In the Chamber of Sacrifice, the cultists of Graz'zt perform a variety of dark rituals to appease their demonic lord. Some of these rituals may include:

1.  Blood Sacrifice: Cultists may offer up a living creature, such as a prisoner or captured enemy, to be sacrificed upon the altar in the center of the room. The blood spilled in the sacrifice is said to feed Graz'zt's power.  
The cultists will first choose a suitable victim, often a prisoner or enemy. The victim is then restrained upon the altar in the center of the room. The cultists will then chant incantations and make offerings to Graz'zt, asking for his favor and blessing upon the sacrifice. Once the demon lord's presence is felt, the cultists will use their weapons to kill the victim, spilling their blood upon the altar. The blood is then collected and used in various dark spells and rituals to empower the cultists and their demonic lord.
	
    
2.  Soul Binding: Cultists may perform a ritual that binds the soul of a willing or unwilling participant to Graz'zt. This is often done as a form of punishment for those who have disobeyed the cult's laws or as a means of offering up a powerful soul to the demon lord.

To perform a soul binding ritual, the cultists will first need a willing or unwilling participant. The participant's soul is then extracted and bound to an object or vessel that represents Graz'zt, such as a statue or amulet. This is done through a series of complex incantations and magical circles drawn on the ground around the participant. Once the soul is bound, the participant becomes a willing or unwilling servant of Graz'zt, often used as a tool to carry out the cult's nefarious plans.
    
3.  Invocation: Cultists may gather in the Chamber of Sacrifice to perform an invocation ritual, calling forth the presence of Graz'zt or other powerful demons to aid them in their dark pursuits.

To perform an invocation ritual, the cultists will gather in a circle around the altar and begin chanting incantations, offering up sacrifices and other offerings to Graz'zt. As the chanting grows louder and more intense, the demon lord's presence is felt in the room, and he may manifest in a physical form to aid the cultists in their dark deeds.

    
4.  Black Magic: The cultists may perform dark magic spells in the chamber, harnessing the power of Graz'zt to manipulate the energies of the world to their will.

The exact procedures of black magic spells vary depending on the spell being cast, but generally, the cultists will first prepare the ritual space with various symbols and offerings. They will then draw upon the power of Graz'zt, harnessing his demonic energy to manipulate the forces of the world to their will. The spells may involve the manipulation of dark energies, summoning of other demons or creatures, or cursing of enemies.
    
5.  Transformation: Cultists may undergo a transformation ritual in the Chamber of Sacrifice, becoming more demonic in appearance and gaining new powers and abilities granted by Graz'zt. This is often reserved for the most devout and powerful members of the cult.

 To undergo a transformation ritual, the cultist must first prove their devotion to Graz'zt through various tests and trials. Once deemed worthy, the cultist is taken to the Chamber of Sacrifice, where they are bound to the altar and offered up as a sacrifice. However, instead of being killed, the cultist is transformed by Graz'zt's power, becoming more demonic in appearance and gaining new powers and abilities. The specifics of the transformation vary depending on the individual, but the end result is always a more powerful and devoted servant of Graz'zt.
