[[temple of Graz'zt]]
[[Dungeons and dragons Session Tree]


The Grand Hall of the temple of Graz'zt is a massive room, adorned with dark tapestries, grotesque sculptures, and flickering torches that cast eerie shadows on the walls. The air is thick with the scent of incense and the sounds of chanting, and the floor is made of smooth obsidian, polished to a high sheen.

At the far end of the hall stands a massive statue of Graz'zt himself, towering over all who enter. The statue is made of black obsidian, and its eyes seem to follow the players as they move around the room. In front of the statue is an altar, covered in bloodstains and surrounded by candles.

Along the sides of the room are several smaller altars, each dedicated to one of Graz'zt's demonic minions. These altars are adorned with offerings of blood, flesh, and precious gems, and the walls behind them are covered in intricate carvings depicting scenes of carnage and debauchery.

As the players explore the Grand Hall, they may notice several interesting objects and opportunities for interaction. For example, there may be hidden compartments in the walls that contain valuable treasures or magical artifacts. Alternatively, they may find hidden passages leading to secret chambers or catacombs beneath the temple.

The players may also encounter various members of the cult of Graz'zt, ranging from lowly acolytes to powerful demon-worshiping spellcasters. These enemies may attempt to hinder the players' progress or even try to capture them for use in dark rituals.

To make this encounter more interesting, you could add some environmental hazards, such as traps or magical barriers that must be overcome before the players can progress. Additionally, you could include some puzzles or riddles that the players must solve in order to uncover the secrets of the temple and defeat its leaders.
