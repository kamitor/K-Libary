The Cult of Graz'zt is a secretive organization that worships the demon lord Graz'zt as a god. The cult is said to be made up of individuals who are seeking power and wealth, and who are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals.

The cult is known to be highly organized, with strict hierarchies and initiation rituals that involve blood sacrifice and demonic rituals. Its members wear black robes and are often marked with the symbol of Graz'zt - a stylized seven-pointed star.

The cult's ultimate goal is to summon Graz'zt to the mortal realm, where he can rule over the world as a god of darkness and evil. To achieve this, the cult seeks to amass power and influence, both through political means and by infiltrating and corrupting key organizations and individuals.

The cult is rumored to have a stronghold deep within the forest, where they conduct their rituals and plan their schemes. They are said to be guarded by powerful demons and other demonic creatures, making them a formidable foe for any who would oppose them.

Despite their evil intentions, the Cult of Graz'zt has managed to attract a small following of individuals who are drawn to their promises of power and wealth. These individuals are often desperate or misguided, and may not fully understand the true nature of the cult they have joined.

The druids of the Twilight Circle are aware of the cult's existence, and they keep a watchful eye on their activities. They recognize the danger that the cult poses to the forest and its inhabitants, and are prepared to take action should the cult's plans ever come to fruition.



Graz'zt is one of the demon lords who rules over the abyss, a plane of existence in the Dungeons and Dragons multiverse. He is often described as a darkly handsome and charismatic figure, with blue-black skin, six fingers on each hand, and glowing green eyes.

Graz'zt is known for his cunning and manipulation, as well as his obsession with pleasure and indulgence. He is said to be a master of seduction and is known to use his powers of charm and persuasion to bend others to his will.

Despite his alluring appearance, Graz'zt is a cruel and sadistic demon lord who revels in the suffering of others. He is known for his love of torture and is said to keep a personal harem of slaves who he subjects to unspeakable horrors.

Graz'zt's power is vast, and he commands a legion of demons and other monstrous creatures. He is often seen as a rival to other demon lords, such as Demogorgon and Orcus, and his ultimate goal is to conquer and rule over the entire abyss.

Although Graz'zt is a demon, he is worshipped as a god by some mortals who are drawn to his power and charisma. These cultists often engage in dark and twisted rituals in his name, and they are known to be among the most dangerous and fanatical worshippers in the multiverse.
