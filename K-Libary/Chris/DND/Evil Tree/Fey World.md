5.  **The Dance of the Satyrs:** Every hundred years, the satyrs of Sylvestria hold a grand celebration, inviting all the magical creatures of the forest to dance and revel under the moonlight.

Objective: The players have been invited to attend the Great Sylvestrian Feast. The objective of the session is for the players to participate in the various activities and challenges at the feast, including a grand scavenger hunt, a pie-eating contest, and a riddle challenge.

Encounters:

1.  Scavenger Hunt: The players are divided into teams and given a list of items to find in the forest.

The reward for solving all the riddles is a magical talisman that provides protection against forest magic.

I am born in fire, but never burned, I am fleeting as the wind, yet never turn, I am fierce as a lion, but never roar, I am water and air, but never more.

What am I?

The answer is "Dragonfly".

One possible special item that the fey people could give to the party for the ritualistic skill challenge to banish the demon tree is the "Chalice of Sylvan Light".

The Chalice is a beautifully crafted silver goblet that glows with an inner light. It was gifted to the fey people by their patron deity, the god of nature, and has the power to channel the energy of the forest and amplify it into a powerful burst of magical energy.

In order to use the Chalice in the ritualistic skill challenge to banish the demon tree, the party must first gather a series of rare and magical ingredients from around the forest, which the fey people will provide hints and guidance for. These ingredients could include rare flowers, the bark of ancient trees, and even the spores of the magical mushrooms found in the forest.

Once the ingredients have been gathered, the Chalice must be filled with a mixture of the ingredients and blessed by the fey people in a sacred ceremony. During the ritualistic skill challenge, the party will be required to make a series of skill checks to channel their energy into the Chalice, culminating in a final check to release the energy and banish the demon tree from the forest.

The Chalice of Sylvan Light can only be used once, but its power is immense and could potentially even restore the health of the forest and its inhabitants after the demon tree's banishment.


The Fey people can give the following hints to help the party with the ritualistic skill challenge to banish the demon tree:

1.  The ritual requires an object imbued with nature's energy and blessed by a powerful nature deity. The object can be a piece of rare crystal or a gemstone found deep in the earth.
    
2.  The ritual must be performed under the light of a full moon, and the participants must be attuned to the natural world and in harmony with their surroundings.
    
3.  The participants must be able to channel their inner energy and focus it on the object. This can be achieved through meditation and deep breathing exercises.
    
4.  The ritual requires the use of powerful nature magic, which can only be performed by those with a deep connection to the natural world. The Fey people can provide a list of powerful nature spells that can aid in the ritual.
    

The item that the Fey people can give to the party is a rare crystal imbued with the essence of nature. This crystal has been blessed by a powerful nature deity and can be used to focus the party's energy during the ritual. The crystal also has the ability to absorb and neutralize dark magic, making it the perfect tool to banish the demon tree.
