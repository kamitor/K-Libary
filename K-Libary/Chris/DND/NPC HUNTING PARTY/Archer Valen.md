Archer Valen is a lean and rugged-looking human ranger. He has piercing green eyes and a shaved head, with a scruffy beard covering his chin. He wears a hooded leather jerkin and a cloak made of wolf pelts that drapes over his shoulders. He has a belt adorned with various pouches and a quiver of arrows slung over his shoulder.

Valen is quiet and observant, often preferring to let his actions speak for him rather than his words. He's a skilled tracker and archer, with a keen sense of his surroundings. He's always on the lookout for danger, and his cautious nature makes him an asset in the party's adventures.

Valen's preferred weapon is his trusty longbow, which he's crafted himself with great care. He carries a pair of hunting knives for close combat situations. He's also skilled in survival, able to forage for food and set traps to catch game.

Despite his gruff exterior, Valen has a soft spot for animals and nature. He's fiercely protective of the forest he calls home and the creatures that reside within it. He follows the teachings of his deity, a nature god who preaches the balance of life and death.

In battle, Valen is deadly accurate with his longbow, able to take down enemies from a distance with ease. He's also a skilled hunter, able to track his prey and take them down with stealth and precision.
