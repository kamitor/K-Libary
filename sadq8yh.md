### Part Three: Gavriel's Grim Gambit

#### Discovering the Temple of Selûne

As the adventurers navigate the final stretch of the desert, guided by the stars and the information gathered from their encounters, they come upon the temple. It's an ancient structure, half-buried by sand, with moonlight reflecting off its surfaces, revealing Selûne's symbols and protective wards.

#### The Temple's Guardians

Upon entering, the party is met by the temple's guardians, ethereal figures that radiate a soft, moonlit glow. These guardians, once mortal followers of Selûne, now serve in death to protect the temple and its secrets. They initially view the adventurers with suspicion but may be persuaded (Persuasion DC 15) of the party's good intentions.

#### The Aegis of Netheril

Deep within the temple, in a chamber illuminated by moonlight streaming through an opening in the ceiling, the party finds the Aegis. It's an ornate shield, pulsing with a soft, magical light. As they approach, visions flash before their eyes, showing the Aegis repelling darkness and absorbing magical energy.

#### Revelation of the Plan

- **Encounter with a Harper Spy**: In the temple, the party encounters a Harper spy who's been tracking Gavriel's movements. The spy reveals Gavriel's plan to use the Aegis as a beacon to draw the horde into a trap. However, the ritual requires a sacrifice – the life of an innocent, specifically a child from among the refugees sheltering in the temple.
- **Moral Dilemma**: The revelation forces the party to confront the ethical implications of Gavriel's plan. Is the potential to end the horde's threat worth the sacrifice of an innocent life? Can they find another way to use the Aegis without resorting to such dark measures?

#### The Horde Draws Near

As the party deliberates, they learn that the horde, drawn by the concentration of magical energy, is moving closer to the temple. Time is running out, and the party must make a decision.

#### Challenges

1. **Deciphering the Aegis's Secrets**: An Arcana check (DC 18) allows the party to unlock more of the Aegis's capabilities, revealing that it can indeed be used as a beacon without the need for a sacrifice, though doing so would require a ritual of significant power and risk.
2. **Convincing the Guardians**: The guardians are opposed to any plan that involves risking the temple's safety or the lives of those it shelters. A successful Persuasion (DC 20) or Religion (DC 18) check convinces them to aid in the ritual, offering their own power to bolster the party's efforts.
3. **Preparing the Ritual**: The party must gather materials and prepare the temple's grounds for the ritual, a Skill Challenge that requires a combination of Arcana, Survival, and Athletics checks to complete under the pressure of the approaching horde.

#### Conclusion of Part Three

Part Three concludes with the party's decision on how to proceed. Will they follow through with Gavriel's original, dark plan, find a way to use the Aegis without sacrifice, or come up with an entirely different solution? Their choices set the stage for the final confrontation with the horde and determine the fate of the temple, the refugees, and the Aegis of Netheril.

### Part Four: The Crucible of Fate

In Part Four of "Shadows Over Sanctuary," the adventurers face the culmination of their journey. With the horde advancing and the Aegis of Netheril's fate in their hands, they must navigate the moral complexities of their choices and prepare for a confrontation that will determine the future of the temple, the refugees, and possibly the entire region.

#### The Decision

The party stands at a crossroads, with the information and allies they've gathered in the temple. They must decide how to use the Aegis—whether to follow through with Gavriel's plan, enact their ritual without sacrifice, or devise a new strategy entirely. This decision shapes the events to come and tests the party's values and ingenuity.

#### Preparing for the Horde

Regardless of their choice, the party must prepare for the horde's imminent arrival. This preparation involves fortifying the temple's defenses, rallying the refugees and guardians, and potentially conducting the ritual to activate the Aegis.

1. **Fortifying Defenses**: A series of skill checks—Athletics (DC 14) to move heavy objects, Arcana (DC 16) to reinforce magical wards, and Survival (DC 15) to create traps and obstacles—determines the effectiveness of the temple's physical and magical defenses.
    
2. **Rallying Allies**: The party can inspire the refugees and guardians to aid in the defense of the temple. Persuasion (DC 18) or Performance (DC 16) checks can bolster morale, while a successful Religion (DC 17) check can invoke Selûne's blessing, providing a temporary boon to the defenders.
    
3. **Conducting the Ritual**: If the party chooses to use the Aegis in a ritual, they must complete a complex Arcana (DC 20) check, possibly aided by the guardians and any magical knowledge they've acquired. The ritual's success hinges on this check, with partial successes resulting in unforeseen consequences.
    

#### The Horde's Assault

As the ritual reaches its climax or the party braces for a direct assault, the horde arrives. This encounter should be dynamic, reflecting the party's preparations and decisions.

1. **Wave Assault**: The horde attacks in waves, allowing the party to use the defenses they've set up. Each wave should challenge the party in different ways, testing their combat strategy, resource management, and adaptability.
    
2. **The Final Stand**: In the last wave, a powerful lieutenant of the horde, drawn by the Aegis's magic or the ritual's energy, leads the assault. This mini-boss fight should push the party to their limits, requiring them to leverage the environment, their allies, and everything they've learned about teamwork and strategy.
    

#### The Aftermath

The outcome of the battle and the ritual's success (or failure) have lasting repercussions. The party must deal with the immediate aftermath—tending to the wounded, assessing the damage to the temple, and deciding the Aegis's final fate.

1. **The Aegis's Power**: Depending on the ritual's outcome, the Aegis may be destroyed, its power significantly altered, or its full potential unleashed. Each scenario should have tangible effects on the temple, the horde, and the surrounding region.
    
2. **Gavriel's Reaction**: If he survives, Gavriel confronts the party, either to commend their actions or to express his fury and disappointment. This encounter sets the stage for future interactions with the Harpers and may influence the party's standing with the organization.
    
3. **Selûne's Blessing**: If the party acted with wisdom and compassion, they might receive a sign of Selûne's favor—a boon that could aid them in future adventures or a divine vision pointing them toward their next quest.
    

### Conclusion of Part Four

Part Four concludes with the adventurers reflecting on their journey, the choices they've made, and the consequences of those choices. They've faced the darkness, navigated complex moral waters, and emerged changed by their experiences. The fate of the Aegis, the temple, and the horde sets the stage for future adventures in a world that feels alive and responsive to their actions.

### Part Five: Echoes of the Decision

Part Five of "Shadows Over Sanctuary" serves as the denouement, where the adventurers confront the consequences of their actions, reflect on their journey, and look ahead to the future. This final part ties up loose ends, addresses the aftermath of the horde's assault, and sets the stage for future adventures.

#### The Aftermath at the Temple

The battle's dust settles over the temple grounds, revealing the cost of victory or the price of defeat. The temple, though possibly scarred by conflict, stands as a testament to the party's efforts. The survivors among the refugees and guardians gather, their eyes reflecting a mix of gratitude, sorrow, and newfound hope.

- **Tending to the Wounded**: The party assists in healing the injured, using their skills and resources. This act of kindness strengthens their bond with the temple's inhabitants and may earn them Selûne's favor.
- **Assessing the Damage**: A survey of the temple reveals the physical and magical toll of the horde's assault. The party may pledge to help restore the temple, a commitment that could involve future quests to gather rare materials or seek out skilled artisans.

#### Gavriel's Response

Inquisitor Gavriel, upon learning of the outcome, seeks out the party. His reaction varies greatly depending on their choices:

- **If the party followed his plan**: Gavriel expresses a cold satisfaction, emphasizing the necessity of their actions despite the moral cost. He assures them of the Harpers' gratitude, though the party may question the true price of their victory.
- **If the party deviated from his plan**: Gavriel's reaction ranges from begrudging respect for finding another way to outright anger for jeopardizing the mission. This confrontation could strain or sever their ties with the Harpers, or it might lead to a deeper involvement in the organization's internal struggles.

#### Reflection and Rewards

The party takes a moment to reflect on their journey, the decisions they made, and the lives they've touched. This reflection is a chance for character development and for players to articulate their characters' feelings and aspirations.

- **Rewards**: Beyond material rewards, the party gains unique boons for their service. These could include a blessing from Selûne, granting them a minor magical ability or advantage on certain checks; a token from the temple's guardians, serving as a symbol of their honorary membership; or a magical item from the temple's treasures, chosen with care to aid them in their future endeavors.

#### Setting the Stage for Future Adventures

The resolution of "Shadows Over Sanctuary" opens several pathways for future adventures:

- **The Horde's Remnants**: If any elements of the horde remain, the party might be tasked with tracking them down, preventing a resurgence.
- **Gavriel's Ambitions**: Should Gavriel remain a figure of authority within the Harpers, the party could find themselves either opposing his darker schemes or working to reform the organization from within.
- **The Temple's Restoration**: The party may embark on quests to restore the temple, delving into forgotten ruins or negotiating with otherworldly beings for the necessary resources.
- **A New Threat**: The use of the Aegis and the battle against the horde might have attracted the attention of a new, more powerful enemy, setting the stage for the party's next great challenge.

### Conclusion of Part Five

As "Shadows Over Sanctuary" concludes, the adventurers are left with a sense of accomplishment mingled with the weight of their choices. They've made allies and enemies, influenced the fate of the temple and the region, and perhaps changed the course of history. The story ends, but their legend continues, ripe with potential for new adventures in the rich tapestry of the Forgotten Realms.
