## Next Sprint

**Sprint Goal 1**: Visualize Power Dynamics Ecosystem: For the upcoming demo, develop a feature to visualize the entire ecosystem based on a company name within 20 minutes. 

In order to do this: we need to build the ontology first; ontology to describe the supply chanin elements as a schema to help the AI structurize knowledge in a well defined way.

This will help to later help to query the knowledge in a structured way. 
{UNTIL WE HAVE THIS, We cannot Draw the mapping in another way.}

Even if you don't want to see the in between sets, we need to have this in order to map the graphs correct this.

## Sub-Goals:
- [ ] create a protocol to allow the ai to control the UI elements and dynamically render various visualisations.
- [ ] Ask multipule A.I's and Multipule Prompts, to identify the which of the data is correct.
To do reanforcement-learning: data set bouwen, zo that the A.I will always answer the correct information. 
Example: I have 3 models and 3 examples, to have concrete examples; to Label them correctly, so that the error margin will get lower. 40% accurate, 70% accurate > 90% accurate.
- [ ] CREWS need to start working; So that it can start crawling the internet for subquestions: "So it can say: Ah I need more information, go and search the internet".
- [ ] Finetune: protocol to allow the ai to control the UI elements and dynamically render various visualisations
- [ ] Need to build the task scheduler for the A.I Crews - >  so that you can see what tasks are running and what is going on. So you can see it "Build" Data.
- [ ] Visual updates about the crews in the interface, so that we  can see what is running.
- [ ] create an ontology to describe the supply chanin elements as a schema to help the AI structurize knowledge in a well defined way.
- [ ] Load significantly more data into the model to parse
- [ ] Chat system needs to work and update map upon prompt
- [ ] First version of the Application online
