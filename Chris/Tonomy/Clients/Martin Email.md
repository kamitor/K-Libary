Subject: Follow-up on Digital Authentication Systems for Engineers and Hard-Devices and GDPR Compliance


Dear Martin,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing in English so that the foundation can also understand the content of this email and maintain our commitment to radical transparency. I wanted to follow up on our earlier conversation about digital authentication systems for personnel authentication (KA - Kantoor Automatisatie) and hard-devices (IA - Industrial Automatisatie) and how Web 3.0 technologies could potentially solve some of the challenges we discussed while also ensuring compliance with GDPR regulations, specifically in the unique way we are approaching it.

As you may be aware, implementing a digital authentication system for engineers and hardware-devices can be challenging, especially when it comes to maintaining security while also allowing for collaboration and sharing of credentials. Additionally, ensuring compliance with GDPR regulations and BIM can add an additional layer of complexity to the process. After some discussions with my co-founder Jack Tanner, we believe that Web 3.0 technologies may offer a solution to these challenges, especially given that they are open-source and can be integrated seamlessly into your existing systems.

Our technology is designed to protect personal data and give individuals control over their own identity. By using our digital identity and SSO technology, you can also ensure compliance with GDPR regulations. Our advantage over other SSO systems include:

1.  An open-source and customizable solution that can be tailored to specific business needs.
2.  An affordable pricing model for assistance with onboarding and building these networks.
3.  No honeypots of information, reducing the frequency and severity of data breaches.
4.  More advanced security features such as multi-factor authentication and biometric verification.
5.  More granular control over access to specific resources and applications.
6.  Better scalability and support for growing businesses.
7.  Stronger compliance with regulations such as GDPR, BIM, and EH3+.
8.  Using new W3C Self-sovereign identity standards to remain compatible with legacy and new identity system integrations.
9.  Better Identity Management and Self-service options for users.
10.  An option for an on-premise solution for businesses with strict security requirements.

I promised to send you some materials, I'll warn you that they are quite extensive, but we're working on creating a shorter version that you could potentially show to people who you think would be interested. Here are the links:

-   A general introduction to the foundation (work in progress, still a draft): [https://youtu.be/rGCjl3GI1Nw](https://youtu.be/rGCjl3GI1Nw)
-   Learn Blockchain: [https://youtu.be/V9D6Z2J765g](https://youtu.be/V9D6Z2J765g)

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter and discussing further.

Best regards,
