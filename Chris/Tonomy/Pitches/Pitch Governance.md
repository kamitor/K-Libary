The pillar includes measures such as guaranteeing access to affordable housing, promoting gender equality, and ensuring that everyone has access to high-quality education and training.

Problem

1.  Data protection and privacy concerns: The EU has strong regulations in place to protect the personal data of its citizens, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, the exchange of data between EU member states and with third countries can raise concerns about data protection and privacy, particularly when it comes to sensitive personal information such as health data.
According to a study by the Ponemon Institute, the average cost of a data breach for SMEs in Europe is €1.15 million. This cost includes expenses such as legal fees, fines, loss of business, and the cost of restoring systems and reputation.

Another study by the European Union **Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), estimates that the average total cost of a data breach for SMEs in Europe is €1.4 million, with an average cost per record of €130**

3.  Technical barriers to interoperability: The EU's various member states have different systems and standards for collecting and storing data, which can make it difficult for them to exchange information effectively. This can be a significant problem when it comes to policy making, as it can impede the ability of decision-makers to access the data they need to make informed decisions.
According to a study by the European Commission, the average cost of technical barriers to interoperability for SMEs is between €50,000 and €150,000 per year. However, these costs can vary depending on the specific circumstances of each business and the sector they operate in.
    
3.  Legal and regulatory challenges: The EU's data protection and privacy regulations can also be a challenge when it comes to data exchange, as they may limit the ability of member states to share information with one another. Additionally, different member states may have different regulations and requirements for data collection and sharing, which can further complicate the process of exchanging data.



1.  Compliance costs: SMEs may face significant costs in complying with EU regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These costs can include hiring legal and technical experts to help navigate the regulations, as well as making changes to business processes and systems to ensure compliance.
SMEs is estimated to be around €10,000 per year. Additionally, other studies estimates that the average cost of compliance for SMEs is between €5,000 and €40,000 per year.
