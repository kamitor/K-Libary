Are you Lazy? 

How do we fix the motivation bridge?

Things are not good:
Lengthy - Repetitive - Boring

Things are Stimulation to AHDH: Like video games. 

Accountability can make it real. 

Things that are new:

- Do it in a different place: Hangmat: Upside down: While in a sauna. 
- In a new way: with a new technique:
- Variety: Different Flavors, Materials: 
You will get bored out of your hobbies earier;

Find weirder, faster or cooler ways of doing the same thing. 

Things that are urgent - This is why we procrastinate: 

**Regular Milestones:** Delivery Moments on a regular basis where you have to present.
**Timers Are useful:** See how much you can get done in a set amount of time. 
Check in from time to time: Shame-Free accountability: 

**Things that are of personal interest:**
- Know that I would put them down for a while till they become new;
- Interest based learners: Problems I'm currently tackling;
- Before you start something get yourself interested in the problem.
