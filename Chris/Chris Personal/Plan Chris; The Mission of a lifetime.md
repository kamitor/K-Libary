## What’s the hard part?

Is it taking the first step and braving the wilderness (metaphorically or otherwise)? Coming up with an idea, or executing it? Is it [motivating yourself](https://www.intelligentchange.com/blogs/read/the-do-something-approach-to-motivation) to set out on a journey, or keep going? Everything we do comes with the hardest part; a bridge over a scary abyss to cross, a steep and snowy mountain to climb, or a dark and stormy sea to sail to get to the easier side. It takes courage – that’s the hard part.

What is your bridge, your mountain, or your sea? What is the biggest [challenge and obstacle](https://www.intelligentchange.com/blogs/read/6-ways-to-deal-with-daily-challenges-and-obstacles) on your way? Define its edges and contents to conquer your fear and proceed. Nobody can tell you whether to take a leap of faith or not. Make a plan and think it through. The hardest part of your work is usually what will have the biggest, or even transformative impact on the outcome you seek. [The obstacle is the way](https://www.intelligentchange.com/blogs/read/lessons-from-stoic-philosophers).

## How are you spending your time?

[Time is of the essence](https://www.intelligentchange.com/blogs/read/focus-time-technique). We have a finite number of days and hours in our lifetime and, since there is no way to predict how long we’ll be able to enjoy our journey, being mindful of how we spend our most valuable asset is critical to our success and happiness.

Is your calendar filled with essential to-dos that can take your game to another level? Does it contain enough space for tackling the hard part of your undertaking? Is sufficient time for [rest and self-care](https://www.intelligentchange.com/blogs/read/the-gift-of-a-day-off) included? Can you devote an hour a day to improving your health and wellbeing? Are all the meetings throughout the week scheduled with [people who bring value into your life](https://www.intelligentchange.com/blogs/read/five-key-relationships)? Your calendar is your life. [Plan it wisely](https://www.intelligentchange.com/blogs/read/best-time-management-tips).

## What do you need to know?

Knowledge is power (provided that we actively use it). In order to do our work effectively, we need to know how and we need relevant skills. Our education stretches far beyond the classroom at school. If you are truly invested in making your dreams come true, you need to learn, change, shift, and adjust your perspective regularly. [Know who you are at your core](https://www.intelligentchange.com/blogs/read/how-to-be-yourself). Everything else can be debatable.

What your work can greatly benefit from is your devotion, your abilities, and your self-awareness. When you check all three, you have the guts to begin, the expertise to continue, and the heart to never give up. [Nobody’s perfect](https://www.intelligentchange.com/blogs/read/the-effects-of-perfectionism-on-happiness-and-success). Knowing your limits and shortcomings well will enable you to plan how much time and effort you need to invest in self-improvement. Knowing your talents and strengths will point you in the right direction.

## What is the scary part?

![5 questions to design your life](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1186/0402/files/IC-5-questions-2.jpg?v=1624359296)

Is it the uncertainty of stepping into the unknown? [Fear of failure](https://www.intelligentchange.com/blogs/read/blessings-in-disguise-7-lessons-on-how-to-fail-well)? Making the wrong decision? [Loneliness](https://www.intelligentchange.com/blogs/read/alone-time)? Whatever you are scared of, venture there. Fear is a compass that points you towards your North Star – the thing you care about the most. If you have the courage to follow your fear, you may end up living your dream life. But if you never try, you’ll never know.

**Get comfortable feeling uncomfortable.** Think which decisions and what outcome of your actions makes you feel [expansive or contracted](https://www.intelligentchange.com/blogs/read/how-our-body-makes-decisions) inside. You’ll find that most of the time, whatever gives you that expansive feeling leads through fear – rename it to tame it. _Hello Bob, how are we doing today?_ Befriend your apprehension, it will never be entirely gone from whatever you do anyway. Seek discomfort.

## Is it worth it?

[Plan for success](https://www.intelligentchange.com/blogs/read/how-to-set-achievable-goals-guide) and it will be. However, analyze your answers to the questions above to get a clear picture of what you _really_ want. [Define your emotions](https://www.intelligentchange.com/blogs/read/gaining-emotional-literacy-with-plutchik-s-wheel) tied to this project, reflect on the road ahead, and evaluate potential losses. What are you willing to sacrifice along the way?

Prepare for a long, winding, and perhaps treacherous path. Nothing worth having comes easily. What will it take for you to get where you want to be? Will the outcome of your undertaking benefit and serve you and others? Will it add value to their lives? Does the end justify the means? At the finish line of your journey you should arrive as the best possible version of yourself, hopefully having changed the world for the better, even if ever so slightly.

Chris believes that with Tonomy Foundation he has found a couple of life-forfilling goals that could help him reach his true potential; 
Chris thinks he can be a true visionary leader for Tonomy, entering the history books together with Martur Luther King, 
1.  Martin Luther King Jr. - King was a charismatic and visionary leader who was known for his ability to inspire and motivate people to work toward social justice and equality.
2. Leo Tolstoy. He was a renowned writer and philosopher who challenged the traditional views of his time on religion, politics, and society.

Commit to Plan Africa-Hunger from Mike;
Chris is in high need to take care of his body and mind, and is currently in a pretty weak state; this does not allow him to forfill his goals and ambitions which he knows he could achieve. To help with this, it can be best to start with the PHYSICAL rather than the Mental.
Chris shoudnt only do the excersize, but should do the video's too. this will help Chris get over his current stage-fear.

Chris wants to be autonomous; not just in the fact that he wants to make his own decisions, but that he wishes to *agree* with his own actions.
Chris has very strong ideals and values and the holds very strongly to his heart.
Chris has come to reliase that he has not been treating himself and others with enough respect.
The concept of not honoring boundries and agreements has been a life-long struggle for Chris; 

To satisfy the need for autonomy, chris should be encouraged to pursue their own goals and make choices that are consistent with their values and interests. 
Chris thanks Mike's presistant trying to help him here; as Chris suddenly realizes that he has been saying exactly this, with "it's your domain", "do what you want".
However, Chris is perplexed by Mike's words as his other suggestions say that he wishes to "control or manage Chris"; Words that seem to contradict eachother. 

To satisfy the need for competence, individuals should be encouraged to develop their own skills and competencies, and to pursue goals that are challenging but attainable.

GOAL: Checkup on my progress to become more "integer"
Mission: Plan and Setup monitoring with Joost

Laaste 4 weken heb ik geen checkup gehad met joost
Wel heb ik een checkup gehad met de doctor
Laaste contact met Joost was dat ik erg depressief was, en liet merken dat ik suicidale gedachte had.
Deze gedachte had ik schijnbaar al een hele lange tijd 

Ik ben inmiddels in spanje

**Wat gaat goed**

Ik praat meer over mijn gevoelens
Ik houd meer rekening met meself
Ik heb even flink gehuild bij mijn vriend (eindelijk)

**wat gaat fout**

Ik merk dat ik nog steeds tijd monitoring Achteraf doe in plaats van tijdens, wat ervoor zorgt dat ik niet 100% grip heb op mijn doen en laten.
Ik merk dat ik nog steeds geen bloeddruk meet
Ik merk dat ik nog steeds inconsitent ben met mijn ritalin inname
Ik merk dat als ik ritalin neem dat mijn werken verbetered
Ik merk dat als mijn ritalin uitgewerkt is dat ik extreem moe word
Ik merk dat ik slecht voor meself zorg, en dat ik meself niet neerzet voor success

**Wat gaan we volgende keer beter doen**

**Waar moet joost op letten**

Chris the Enabeler - Chris makes the magic happen
What does chris Believe?
What does he want?

How does chris do this?

What does this mean?

Waarom denk ik dat ik een incompetent persoon ben?

Hoe kunnen we dit vasthouden,
- Opschrijven, Journalen, gedachtes legen, Gedachtes delen. 
- assertiviteit

Wat is stabiel wat is niet stabiel

Stabiel

Instabiel
Kort - Ritalin 


Wat zijn de doelen 

Stabiliteit - De basis echt goed hebben.


Waar kunnen we concreet mee aan de slag?



-   Take care of your body. The body and mind are powerfully linked so try to stay physically active, as exercise can help improve mood. Focus on other basics of wellbeing too, like getting a good night’s sleep and eating a balanced diet.
-   Challenge negative thinking patterns. Even if you don’t truly believe the positive version, start to notice when the negative thinking creeps in, and play [devil’s advocate](https://hackspirit.com/signs-youve-sold-your-soul-to-the-devil/). Aim to be kinder to yourself.
-   Keep a [gratitude journal](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/gratitude_journal). Science has proven that gratitude is a powerful antidote for negativity. Studies have shown that [gratitude makes you happier](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier) as it makes people feel more positive emotions, relish good experiences, improve their health, deal with adversity, and build strong relationships.
-   [Practice mindfulness](https://hackspirit.com/art-mindfulness-practical-guide-living-moment/). Mindfulness can help you to understand your emotions better, cope better with difficult thoughts, and feel calmer.
-   [Connect with people](https://hackspirit.com/how-to-talk-to-people/). Relationships are incredibly important to our wellbeing. They not only help us to build a sense of belonging and self-worth, but they give us emotional support.
-   Seek the support of a professional. If you think you might be struggling with mental health issues like depression, anxiety, or stress, speak to your doctor or [a therapist](https://hackspirit.com/signs-your-therapist-is-attracted-to-you/).
