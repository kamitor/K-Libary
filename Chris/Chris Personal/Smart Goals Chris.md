    3.  ✅ The person knows what to do to manage that process
    4.  ☑️ For each sprint demo, a number is presented showing the number of people going through each process, e.g., X many people joined discord, Y many people were reached out to, Z many of them converted, etc.

    1.  ✅ CRM can be joined by a new member easily
    2.  ☑️ Reporting exists that shows what each sales member is doing each two weeks

## Goal 2 - rebuild trust with the non-profit foundation

_(Leadership - Autonomy??? @Chris Verhoef )_

Develop and implement a plan to **rebuild trust with the non-profit foundation** by taking responsibility for past mistakes, apologizing, taking corrective action, being transparent, following through on commitments, and consistently demonstrating integrity and transparency in all interactions and activities. This will be achieved by the end of the quarter and monitored monthly for progress.

**Smart Goals**

2.  Communication and commitment (follow-through of your word)
    1.  ✅ Research and propose a training/workshop to help with communication and commitment setting. Examples of this could be:
        -   Assertiveness Training; Specifically and auto-response; Reflexes and Strategy;
        -   Philosophy Course?
        -   Communication Training Course
        -   Training for communication on saying what you mean and committing to only the things you want to commit to;
3.  Focus
    1.  ☑️ Make sure you only have 2 tasks on your plate at the same time; This is always visible in Zenhub; Maybe Zenhub can give a report on this;
    2.  ☑️ Any Tonomy work needs to be in a task. If not, you must create it and let Jack/Mike know.
4.  Health improvements
    1.  ☑️ Do exercise at least 2 times a week;
    2.  ☑️ Monitor and report food intake, weight and sleep cycles;

# Reflection and effects of these goals

We will monitor many of the above goals every two weeks at the Sprint demo or after and have time to reflect on how this is going.

At the end of the three-month period, we will explicitly reflect on how well Chris has achieved these goals.

We will seriously consider removing Chris from the Tonomy Foundation operational team if these goals are unmet. Chris will stay inside the Tonomy Foundation board.
