[[VR Fork Pitch]]
[[Why VR]]

# Why

Had a short meet with Marieke in VR; She really saw the value as the room came alive.
She is of the opinion that we should host one of the events here, and I agree.

She has two suggestions: 
- Web 3.0 For Food - 
	- Sessie ; van Woesndag ; > in VR
- Inleiding in the Open Food Chain accerator
	- Meer geintersseerd in het accelerator program. 

And suggests we go for the first one:

## How

Marieke suggests we have a meeting with Max and Patricia on how to acomplish this in which at leasst the following is discussed:

Why are we doing this? What is the goal
What are we going to do? What is the potential outcome
Who should do what? What are the responsibilities
What are the steps to acomlish this

### What

This means we could host content in an interactive way and really connect with people. 
It sounds silly, but the first time you try you'll see what it means. and You'll love it.
Be BOLD like marieke and try.
