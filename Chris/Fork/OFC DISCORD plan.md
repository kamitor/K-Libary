Why Discord for 3.0

Discord is essential for web 3.0 initiatives as it offers more than just a relay for social media, it offers community building, communication and coordination for successful collaboration and coordination of a project.



## How To Acomplish Effective Discord: 

1.  Develop a marketing strategy: Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy to promote the OFC blockchain and its token. The strategy should include various marketing tactics such as social media marketing, content marketing, influencer marketing, and paid advertising.
    
2.  Utilize Discord as a communication and engagement tool: Use Discord to engage with the community and keep them updated on the latest developments in the OFC blockchain. Create a Discord server and assign roles to the community members based on their level of engagement and expertise in the field. Encourage discussions around the use cases of the OFC blockchain and promote the adoption of the token.
    
3.  Launch an incubator program: Create an incubator program to encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build projects on the OFC blockchain. Offer funding and resources to help them develop and launch their projects. This will not only create demand for the OFC token but also create a network effect that will drive the adoption of the blockchain.
    
4.  Offer direct buy-in for the OFC token: Offer a direct buy-in for the OFC token through the Discord server. This will allow the community members to invest in the blockchain and create demand for the token.
    
5.  Offer blockchain as a service: Offer the OFC blockchain as a service to businesses and organizations looking to use blockchain technology. This will not only create a revenue stream for the OFC but also increase the demand for the OFC token.
    
6.  Regularly update the community: Keep the community updated on the progress of the OFC blockchain and its projects. Regularly share updates on the latest developments, partnerships, and milestones achieved. This will keep the community engaged and create demand for the token.

## How to get Engagement

1.  Host an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session: Schedule an AMA with a well-known blockchain influencer or expert to join the OFC Discord server and answer questions from the community. This will create a buzz and attract more people to join the server, increasing exposure for the OFC project.
    
2.  Community building: The OFC can create a dedicated channel for community members to share their ideas, insights, and feedback. This channel can be used to encourage discussions on the OFC project, its token, and other related topics.
    
3.  Host events: The OFC can host events such as trivia games, raffles, and other fun activities in the Discord server to engage community members. The winners of such events could receive rewards in OFC tokens, which could encourage them to continue participating in future events.
    
4.  Incubator Program: OFC can create an incubator program and use the Discord server to facilitate the application process. The program can provide mentorship and resources to help startups and developers build on the OFC blockchain. This can attract entrepreneurs and developers who are interested in using the technology and potentially drive demand for the OFC token.
    
5.  Direct Buy-in: OFC can provide a way for members to directly buy the OFC token using the Discord server. This can be done by creating a dedicated channel or integrating a bot that can handle token purchases.
    
6.  Running blockchain as a service: OFC can provide a way for members to run their own blockchain nodes and earn rewards in OFC tokens for supporting the network. The Discord server can be used to provide support and resources to help members set up their nodes and start earning rewards.

The idea of Discord is that 


How To
1.  Set up a dedicated channel on the OFC Discord server to introduce and explain the incubator program to the community. Provide detailed information about the benefits of participating in the program, including access to funding, mentorship, and other resources to help develop and grow blockchain-related projects.
    
2.  Use the Direct Buy-In feature on the OFC website to allow users to purchase OFC tokens directly through the Discord server. This would make it easy for users to invest in the token without having to navigate away from the community.
    
3.  Set up a separate channel on the OFC Discord server to allow users to ask questions about the token and its use. This channel would be moderated by experts who can provide clear and accurate answers to help users understand the benefits of the OFC blockchain and its associated token.
    
4.  Use the Discord server to provide updates on the development and deployment of the OFC blockchain as a service. This would help keep the community engaged and excited about the potential of the technology.
    
5.  Host events and competitions on the OFC Discord server to promote the adoption of the blockchain. For example, hosting a hackathon to encourage developers to create innovative applications on the OFC blockchain, with prizes awarded for the best ideas.
    
6.  Use social media channels to promote the OFC Discord server and encourage new members to join. By building a strong and engaged community on Discord, the OFC can help to drive adoption of the blockchain and its associated token, ultimately leading to greater success for the project.

Maybe we can make a contest for the "most intresting" article in new Food Tech
Or the latest in Web 3.0 Tech
Or maybe the worst Greenwashing attempt in the last time
Or maybe look for the most intresting green-supportive event
And the winner, doesn't just get that article posted, but we make it with their Discord Name + Avatar :) 
(gives a good reason to get a good discord avatar too)

But we need more things like this: 
Do you have ideas on "What can we get the PUBLIC to Produce for us? 

Here are more suggestions:

## Onboarding

1.  Set up the Onboarding Channel: Create a designated onboarding channel for new members to enter upon joining the server. Set up the onboarding feature to ask the questions we previously discussed in a clear and concise manner. Ensure that the rules of the server are clearly stated and that new members agree to them.
    
2.  Assign the "New Member" Role: Upon completion of the onboarding questions, assign new members the "New Member" role.
    
3.  Assign Roles Based on Onboarding Answers: Create roles based on the onboarding questions and assign them to new members based on their answers. For example, if a new member answers that they are interested in the technical aspects of blockchain, assign them the "Developer" role. If a member expresses interest in investing, assign them the "Investor" role.
    
4.  Set Up Role-Specific Channels: Create channels that are specific to each role. For example, create a "Development" channel for members with the "Developer" role to discuss technical aspects of the blockchain. Create a "Trading" channel for members with the "Investor" role to discuss the token price and investment opportunities.
    
5.  Create General Channels: Create channels that are open to all members to encourage discussion and collaboration. For example, create a "General" channel for general discussion and a "Projects" channel for members to share and discuss potential projects that could use the OFC blockchain technology.
