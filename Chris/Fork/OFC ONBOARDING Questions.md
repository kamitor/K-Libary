[[OFC DISCORD plan]]
Here are some questions that you could ask in step 4 of the onboarding process:

1.  What is your experience with blockchain technology?

-   This question will help you to gauge the level of understanding that users have about blockchain technology, and will help you to tailor your messaging accordingly.

2.  How did you hear about Open Food Chain?

-   This question will help you to understand which marketing channels are most effective, and will help you to optimize your marketing efforts going forward.

3.  Have you ever participated in a blockchain project before?

-   This question will help you to identify potential contributors to your blockchain project, and will also help you to gauge the level of expertise that your community has in this area.

4.  What interests you most about Open Food Chain?

-   This question will help you to understand the specific aspects of your project that resonate most with your community, which will help you to create content and messaging that is more engaging and effective.

5.  What challenges do you see in the adoption of blockchain technology in the food industry?

-   This question will help you to identify potential roadblocks to adoption of your solution, which will help you to tailor your messaging and outreach efforts to address these challenges.

To assign roles to the new people coming in based on their answers to the onboarding questions, you can use Discord's built-in feature called "Auto-Role". This feature allows you to assign a specific role to a user automatically when they join the server based on their answers to the questions in the onboarding form.

To use this feature, you can create roles that correspond to each of the answers in the onboarding form. For example, if one of the questions is "What is your experience level with blockchain technology?", you could create roles such as "Beginner", "Intermediate", and "Expert" to correspond to the possible answers.

Then, in the Discord server settings, navigate to the "Roles" section and find the role you want to assign automatically. Click the three dots to the right of the role and select "Edit". In the settings for that role, enable the "Auto-assign role" option and select the corresponding answer for that role.

Repeat this process for each of the roles you want to assign automatically based on the onboarding questions. When a new user joins the server and completes the onboarding form, Discord will automatically assign the appropriate role based on their answers.
