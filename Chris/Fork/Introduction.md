Hello Everyone! It's I, Chris! Or Captain red beard / Kamitor. Some (hopefully) good news! It's official, I've rejoined the fork! ![ðŸ˜„](https://discord.com/assets/626aaed496ac12bbdb68a86b46871a1f.svg) I will try my very best to make everyone feel included. I'll be doing community management and using the discord to do that. Currently a plan is formulating on how to exactly do that, so if you have any suggestions let me know! Who is this guy? Chris joined the fork when the fork was just Marieke and a crazy plan together with Kirsten. Chris previously worked as a trainer and brainstormer to try and get some consultancy gigs or other stuff. It has mixed results, education is always a hard sell. Some people still remember the training so it was not all for nothing ![ðŸ™‚](https://discord.com/assets/da3651e59d6006dfa5fa07ec3102d1f3.svg) What does this guy do? Chris likes to talk a lot, and trough trial and error he's become pretty good at it. He has a good idea on how most people work and prides himself getting the best out of people. You might know Chris as a technical person, which is true to an extent, but Chris and technology don't always work (see events of the fork). Chris is a mixed bag of business tech and management, but what he mostly likes to do is connect with people on a fundamental level. Tell Chris what you like, and Chris will try to give it to you to make you happy ![ðŸ˜„](https://discord.com/assets/626aaed496ac12bbdb68a86b46871a1f.svg) Come to Chris if you are feeling sad or if you want someone to bounce your idea off. Chris's Strategy is "Social Engagement". He likes to connect people and make them happy.
