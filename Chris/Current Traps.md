- Copper plate - 2 crossbows - 1 dagger - Soap - Flask of acid - Burning oil - scraps of metal - Rope


I want to use the 2 crossbows to create 2x 3 Crossbow Bolt Barage
The Burning Oil to Create a Oil Granade; x1
Using the Soap, create 1 soap bomb
3 x Alchemical Smoke Bomb

Use the acid and the copper plate to create 1 spray device.

2.  Trap: Acidic Spray
    
    -   Utilize the copper plate and scraps of metal to create a small acidic spray device.
    -   Connect the flask of acid to the device.
    -   Trigger: Tripwire or lever.
    -   Effect: The device sprays acid in a cone-shaped area, dealing 4d6 acid damage to creatures caught within (Dexterity saving throw for half damage, DC 14).
    -   Reset: Manual reset or recharge mechanism.

3.  Trap: Crossbow Bolt Barrage
    
    -   Modify one of the crossbows to shoot multiple bolts at once.
    -   Attach several bolts to the crossbow using the scraps of metal and rope.
    -   Trigger: Pressure plate or lever.
    -   Effect: The modified crossbow fires a barrage of bolts in a designated direction, targeting all creatures in a 15-foot line (Attack: +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., line). Each target hit takes 1d8 piercing damage.
    -   Reload: Manual reload required.

4.  Trap: Oil Grenade
    
    -   Fill a container with the burning oil.
    -   Attach the container securely with the rope.
    -   Trigger: Impact or thrown manually.
    -   Effect: The container shatters upon impact, creating an area of difficult terrain (10-foot radius). The area becomes covered in burning oil, dealing 2d6 fire damage to any creature starting its turn or entering the area (Dexterity saving throw for half damage, DC 13).
    -   Reset: Consumable item.
5.  Throwable: Soap Bomb
    
    -   Wrap a chunk of soap with the scraps of metal and rope, creating a makeshift bomb.
    -   Range: 20/60 ft.
    -   Hit: +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target.
    -   Effect: On a hit, the soap bomb explodes, releasing a slippery substance. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 12) or fall prone. Additionally, the area within a 10-foot radius becomes difficult terrain until cleaned.

7.  Bubble Distraction:
    
    -   Utilize the jug of alchemy to create a large quantity of soapy water.
    -   Blow bubbles into the air to create a distraction or obscure vision.
    -   Creatures within the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12) or become fascinated by the bubbles for a short duration, losing focus on their surroundings.
    -   This can provide an opportunity for stealthy movement or distraction during encounters.

8.  Throwable: Alchemical Smoke Bomb
    
    -   Combine the jug's alchemical substance with a smoke-producing material.
    -   Wrap the mixture in a cloth and secure it with rope.
    -   Range: 20/60 ft.
    -   Effect: Upon impact, the bomb creates a cloud of dense smoke, heavily obscuring the area in a 15-foot radius. Creatures within the smoke suffer from disadvantage on Perception checks and attack rolls that rely on sight.
