[[Graz'zt]]

The Chamber of Sacrifice is a dark and foreboding room within the temple of Graz'zt where the cult carries out their rituals of blood sacrifice. The room is located deep within the temple, accessible only through a series of winding corridors and secret passages.

The chamber itself is circular in shape, with walls made of obsidian and black stone. The floor is a raised dais of polished black marble, upon which stands a large stone altar. The altar is adorned with intricate carvings of demonic figures and symbols, and is stained with the blood of countless sacrifices.

The air in the chamber is thick with the scent of incense and burning candles, and the walls are adorned with dark tapestries depicting scenes of torture and demonic revelry. At the center of the room stands a large brazier filled with smoldering coals, which cast an eerie red glow over everything in the room.

In the corners of the chamber stand several stone pillars, each carved with grotesque images of demons and other foul creatures. These pillars are used to chain sacrifices during the cult's rituals, and the players may find themselves bound to them if they are captured by the cultists.

Within the chamber, the players may find several cultists engaged in dark rituals, performing blood sacrifices and invoking the name of Graz'zt. There may also be various sacrificial implements scattered around the room, such as knives, ritual daggers, and bowls for collecting blood.

If the players are able to overcome the cultists and disrupt their rituals, they may find clues or artifacts that could help them in their quest. They may also discover hidden passages or secrets within the temple that could lead them closer to the heart of the cult's plans. However, the danger within the Chamber of Sacrifice is very real, and the players will need to be careful if they hope to emerge unscathed.
