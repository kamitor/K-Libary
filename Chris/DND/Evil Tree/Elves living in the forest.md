The Twilight Forest is home to a tribe of reclusive elves who have lived there for centuries. They are known as the Moonshadow Elves, and they are fiercely protective of their forest home.

[[Twilight Forest]]
The forest near Cormyr is known as the Twilight Forest, and it is said to be a place of great magic and mystery. Legends tell of a powerful elven mage who once lived in the forest and used his magic to protect it from outsiders. It is said that his spirit still lingers in the forest, and that those who enter it without his permission will face his wrath.

In recent years, the forest has become a place of great interest to the dragonmarked houses, who believe that it contains a powerful source of magical energy. Some say that the houses are searching for a way to tap into this energy and use it for their own purposes, while others believe that they are trying to prevent others from accessing it.

The forest is also home to a powerful druidic order known as the Twilight Circle, who are said to be the protectors of the forest and its magic. They are fiercely territorial and will not hesitate to drive out anyone who they perceive as a threat to the forest. However, they are also known to be wise and compassionate, and those who show respect for the forest and its inhabitants may earn their trust and aid

In fact, the reason the Twilight Forest has remained largely untouched by civilization is due to the efforts of the Moonshadow Elves. They have a deep connection to the forest and its magical energies, and they use their knowledge and abilities to keep outsiders from encroaching on their territory.

The Moonshadow Elves have also had a long-standing feud with the Emerald Claw, who have attempted to exploit the forest's magical resources for their own gain. The Moonshadow Elves view the Emerald Claw as a threat to the balance of nature and have been known to launch attacks against them in the past.

Perhaps they warned the players of the dangers of tampering with the forest's magic, or maybe they were even involved in attempting to stop the ritual that created the tree.

Alternatively, the Moonshadow Elves may be interested in the half-dragon half-elf held captive by the Emerald Claw. They may have their own reasons for wanting to keep her safe or to learn what information she possesses.

Regardless, the Moonshadow Elves could provide an interesting and potentially valuable ally to the players as they navigate the dangers of the Twilight Forest. However, earning their trust and assistance may require the players to prove their worth and demonstrate their commitment to preserving the balance of nature
