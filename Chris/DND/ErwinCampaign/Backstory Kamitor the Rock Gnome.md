## Backstory Kamitor the Rock Gnome

Kamitor grew up in a small community of gnomes who lived in rocky hills and mountains. Being a Rock Gnome, he learned the art of tinkering and invention from a young age and was fascinated by the mechanics of the world around him.

Tragedy struck Kamitor early in his life when a violent rockslide destroyed their community, leaving him as the sole survivor. As a young gnome, he was forced to flee for his life, scrambling over rubble and dodging falling boulders. He survived by being trapped in a small pocket of rocks, while he heard his family suffer in the distance. After days of digging, he managed to dig himself out, but he was not able to save his family. This haunts Kamitor to this day, and makes him claustrophobic when confined in small spaces.

Alone and vulnerable, Kamitor had to fend for himself on the unforgiving streets of the nearby city. He quickly learned that the world was a cruel and dangerous place, filled with traps and pitfalls. Kamitor's survival instincts kicked in, and he became adept at picking locks, setting traps, and scavenging for resources.

Despite his natural talents, life on the streets was a constant struggle for Kamitor. He faced constant danger from rival gangs and corrupt officials, and was always on the lookout for a new scheme or hustle to make ends meet. But as the years went by, Kamitor's skills as an artificer grew, and he began to dream of a better life.

His chance came when a group of traveling merchants passed through the city and spotted Kamitor's talent for invention. They offered the young gnome an apprenticeship in their workshop, and Kamitor jumped at the opportunity. For years, he toiled away in the workshop, learning the art of metalworking, alchemy, and magic. Kamitor's mind raced with new ideas and inventions, and he quickly became obsessed with the idea of creating machines of destruction.

When his apprenticeship ended, Kamitor left the workshop and set out on his own. He traveled the land, seeking out new materials and perfecting his craft. He created deadly weapons and magical constructs, honing his skills as an artificer and becoming a master of the Artillerist subclass.

However, Kamitor's newfound power came with a price. He had become fiercely independent and mistrustful of authority figures, which often got him into trouble. He had a reputation as a loose cannon, and was feared by many for his unpredictable nature.

Kamitor's path eventually led him back to the city where he had grown up, and he was immediately confronted with the harsh reality of the criminal underworld. He was taken in by a group of thieves who saw the potential in Kamitor's skills, and he quickly became an integral part of the gang. Kamitor designed deadly traps and weapons for the gang's heists, and his reputation as a master of the Artillerist subclass grew.

But Kamitor's sense of independence soon clashed with his loyalty to the gang. He began to question the morality of their criminal activities, and his conscience began to gnaw at him. He knew that he couldn't continue down this path forever, and eventually, he left the gang and struck out on his own.

Now, Kamitor uses his skills as an artificer to help those in need, whether it's defending a village from marauding monsters or protecting the innocent from corrupt officials. Kamitor is a force to be reckoned with, a brilliant inventor and a fierce fighter. But his past as a member of the criminal underworld is never far behind him, and he knows that he must always be on his guard.

After leaving the group of thieves, Kamitor found himself wandering through the city streets once. It was during this time that they stumbled upon a small, injured squirrel lying in a gutter. The poor creature was barely breathing and Kamitor knew they had to help.

Using their knowledge of mechanics and alchemy, Kamitor fashioned a small breathing apparatus for the squirrel and nursed it back to health. As the days passed, the two formed a bond, and Kamitor named the squirrel "Piep" for the sound it made when it breathed through the apparatus.

Piep quickly became Kamitor's constant companion, following them everywhere they went. The squirrel was especially fond of climbing onto Kamitor's shoulder and chattering excitedly whenever they tinkered with their latest invention. Often piep looks to almost repeat instructions Kamitor tells himself, or at times even tell Kamitor what to do. Kamitor took great care of Piep, creating tiny devices that would help the squirrel gather nuts and seeds, and fashioning a small bed for it to sleep in at night. Piep hides under Kamitor's red hat which he has on when meeting new people, the hat has tiny holes for piep to watch trough, and when she moves the hat seems to move on Kamitor's head indepdantly.

However, Piep's presence also brought new challenges for Kamitor. They now had to factor in the squirrel's safety when navigating the dangerous streets of the city. He also had to be mindful of Piep's well-being during their battles as an Artillerist, especially since Piep's high sensitivty to sound and prowness to panic in sounds. Kamitor was determined to keep Piep safe, and the bond between the two grew stronger every day.

Piep soon became something of a mascot for Kamitor, and the squirrel's presence helped to soften Kamitor's rough exterior. They even began to share their earnings from their inventions with other street urchins, much to Piep's delight. 

Despite the hardships they faced, Kamitor and Piep found solace in each other's company. Together, they continued to explore the city and hone their skills, taking on new challenges and adventures with determination and a sense of purpose.
