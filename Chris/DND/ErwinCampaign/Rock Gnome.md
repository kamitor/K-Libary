This character build focuses on the Artillerist subclass, which specializes in building and deploying magical turrets and constructs to support allies and deal damage to enemies. Kamitor's background as an Urchin gives them a natural affinity for survival skills and traps, which can be useful in combat situations.

In addition to their turret-building abilities, Kamitor can use their Tinker's Tools and Thieves' Tools to create and set traps for enemies. The Replicate Magic Item: Bag of Holding infusion will give them extra storage space for all their mechanical creations, including traps.

The spells and cantrips selected focus on healing, utility, and damage. The Repulsion Shield Wondrous Invention provides additional protection in combat and the City Secrets background feature allows Kamitor to navigate the city's streets and alleys with ease.

## Traps 
As a level 1 Artificer with proficiency in Tinker's Tools and Thieves' Tools, here are some traps that you could potentially build:

1.  Tripwire Trap: This trap involves a wire that is set across a pathway or doorway. When triggered, it causes a loud noise and/or drops a heavy object (such as a net or boulder) onto the target.
   To build this trap, Kamitor would need a sturdy wire or cord, something to hold the wire in place (such as a stake or peg), and a mechanism to trigger the trap (such as a tripwire trigger or pressure plate). They could use their Tinker's Tools to create a simple mechanism for triggering the trap, such as a spring-loaded tripwire.

Once they have their trigger mechanism, Kamitor could attach the wire to the trigger and stake it into the ground, stretching the wire across a pathway or doorway. When an enemy trips the wire, it will release the trigger mechanism, causing a heavy object (such as a net or boulder) to drop onto the target or a loud noise to alert Kamitor and their allies.
  
2.  Poison Needle Trap: This trap involves a hidden needle that is coated with poison. When triggered, the needle springs out and stabs the target, injecting the poison.

To build this trap, Kamitor would need a hidden needle, a mechanism to trigger the trap, and a poison to coat the needle. They could use their Tinker's Tools to create a spring-loaded mechanism to release the needle, and their Thieves' Tools to hide the needle in a location that would be difficult for an enemy to spot.

Once they have their trigger mechanism and hidden needle in place, Kamitor could use their Alchemist's Supplies to apply a poison to the needle, such as a paralyzing or weakening poison. When an enemy triggers the trap, the needle will spring out and inject the poison.

3.  Explosive Trap: This trap involves a hidden explosive device that is triggered when pressure is applied to a certain area (such as a floor tile). When triggered, it explodes, dealing damage to anyone in the area.

To build this trap, Kamitor would need an explosive device, a pressure plate or trigger mechanism, and something to contain the explosion (such as a metal box or ceramic pot). They could use their Tinker's Tools to create a mechanism for triggering the trap, such as a pressure plate that sets off the explosive when stepped on.

Once they have their trigger mechanism in place, Kamitor could load the explosive device into the container and hide it in a location that an enemy is likely to trigger the trap. When the trap is triggered, the explosive will detonate, dealing damage to anyone in the area.

	
4.  Snare Trap: This trap involves a hidden wire loop that is set at ankle height. When triggered, it tightens around the target's leg, immobilizing them.


To build this trap, Kamitor would need a hidden wire loop, something to hold the wire in place, and a mechanism to trigger the trap. They could use their Tinker's Tools to create a simple mechanism for triggering the trap, such as a tripwire or pressure plate.

Once they have their trigger mechanism, Kamitor could stretch the wire loop across a pathway or doorway, securing it in place with a stake or peg. When an enemy triggers the trap, the wire loop will tighten around their leg, immobilizing them.


5.  Acid Spray Trap: This trap involves a hidden container of acid that is triggered when pressure is applied to a certain area. When triggered, it sprays acid in a cone-shaped area, dealing damage to anyone in the area.
    
6.  Blade Trap: This trap involves a hidden blade that swings out from a wall or ceiling when triggered, dealing slashing damage to anyone in the area.
    
7.  Gas Trap: This trap involves a hidden container of gas that is triggered when pressure is applied to a certain area. When triggered, it releases a noxious gas that can cause suffocation or unconsciousness.
    
Traps requires time, resources, and a safe location to set them up. 
5.  cid Spray Trap: To build an acid spray trap, Kamitor would need to create a mechanism that would release a stored container of acid when triggered. Kamitor could use their proficiency with Tinker's Tools to build a device that would release the acid when a certain pressure is applied to a specific area, such as when a target steps on a hidden floor tile or a pressure plate. Kamitor could fill a container with acid and attach it to the mechanism with tubing that would allow the acid to spray out in a cone-shaped area. The acid would deal damage to anyone caught in the area, which could be determined by rolling the appropriate dice according to the rules for acid damage.
    
6.  Blade Trap: To build a blade trap, Kamitor would need to create a hidden blade that would swing out from a wall or ceiling when triggered. Kamitor could use their proficiency with Tinker's Tools to create a mechanism that would allow the blade to swing out when a certain pressure is applied to a specific area, such as when a target steps on a hidden floor tile or a pressure plate. Kamitor could attach a blade to the mechanism and then conceal it with some form of camouflage, such as paint or a removable panel. When triggered, the blade would swing out and deal slashing damage to anyone caught in the area. The amount of damage dealt could be determined by rolling the appropriate dice according to the rules for slashing damage.
    
7.  Gas Trap: To build a gas trap, Kamitor would need to create a hidden container of gas that would release its contents when triggered. Kamitor could use their proficiency with Tinker's Tools to build a device that would release the gas when a certain pressure is applied to a specific area, such as when a target steps on a hidden floor tile or a pressure plate. Kamitor could fill a container with a noxious gas and attach it to the mechanism with tubing that would allow the gas to escape when the trigger is activated. The gas could cause suffocation or unconsciousness, depending on its composition and the amount released. The effects of the gas could be determined by rolling the appropriate dice according to the rules for suffocation or unconsciousness.

1.  Metal wire or cable: This can be used to create tripwire traps or snare traps.
    
2.  Springs: These can be used to create traps that involve sudden movement or impact.
    
3.  Small gears: These can be used to create clockwork traps that can be timed to trigger at specific intervals.
    
4.  Poison or alchemical substances: These can be used to add extra damage to your traps, or to coat your weapons for additional damage.
    
5.  Wood or stone: These can be used to construct trap components such as levers or platforms.
    
6.  Small explosive devices: These can be used to create explosive traps.
    
7.  Adhesives: These can be used to create traps that stick or glue the target in place.
