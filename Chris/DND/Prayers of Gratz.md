Our Dark Lord, Who art in Hell  
Unholy be thy name, Thy Empire come,  
Thine own will be done,  
On Earth as it is in The Inferno.  
Thou gave us the power to take this day  
And lay claim to our daily bread  
And allow us our indulgence's  
As we annihilate those who oppress our indulgence's  
And lead us not into blind servitude but deliver us from tyranny  
For one's own is their kingdom and their strength  
And their fulfillment for we are carnal beasts forevermore,Ave Satanas,  
Hail The Morning Star, Hail Thyself!
