[**Ra**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/ram-portable)**[m](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/ram-portable)**[**, Portable (4 gp)**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/ram-portable) _PHB_

Break down the dungeon door with a +4 bonus to the Strength check. Get your friends to help you for advantage as well! If even all of that fails, _fire bolt_ the door down. If there is [no time constraint](https://tabletopbuilds.com/ability-checks/#Multiple_Checks), this item lets you access doors that are otherwise impossible to breach.

Gears: 2x 2Silvers.

[**Crowbar (2 gp)**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/crowbar) _PHB_

Keep one around to pry open dungeon doors and whatnot. Less effective, but cheaper and more convenient than a portable ram. As with the ram, becomes notably more useful if _fire bolt_ can’t be used to target objects or break down a door.

[**Grappling Hook (2 gp)**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/grappling-hook) _PHB_

Can prove useful for getting around environments with verticality without fully investing into a climber’s kit.

**Raincatcher (1 gp)** _ToA_

Lets you refill your waterskin during long periods of travel, as long as the environment allows it.

[**Hourglass (25 gp)**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/hourglass) _PHB_

Purchasing 1 minute and 1 hour hourglasses can be helpful if your DM requires them for your characters to keep accurate track of time, specifically in the context of spell durations.

[**Lock (10 gp)**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/lock) _PHB_

Comes with a key, use it to lock up your chests and whatnot. Combine it with _arcane lock_ for some [healthy paranoia](https://tabletopbuilds.com/healthy-paranoia/).

[**Magnifying Glass (100 gp)**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/magnifying-glass) _PHB_

A little expensive for starting gear, but can be helpful for a few things. Can start fires, and makes it easier to appraise or inspect small and detailed items.

[**Manacles (2 gp)**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/manacles) _PHB_

Much better at keeping prisoners hostage than rope is, for little cost. Worth keeping around. Ask your DM how long and what it takes to put this on someone.

[**Case, Map or Scroll (1 gp)**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/case-map-or-scroll) _PHB_

Can be a convenient place to keep 10 [_spell scrolls_](https://tabletopbuilds.com/complete-guide-to-spell-scrolls/) stored, when they aren’t hanging from your shield, staff, or other equipment.

[**Piton (5cp)**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/piton) _PHB_

A metal spike that can be used for climbing or other various survival uses like setting up a tent. Nice to have a handful of these in someone’s pack.

[**Spyglass (1,000 gp)**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/spyglass) _PHB_

Its high price makes the spyglass impractical for the minor benefit it brings. However, if you can choose an item from the [gothic trinket table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds/haunted-one), you can start with a spyglass in your equipment to sell for a lump sum.

[**Tent, Two-Person (2 gp)**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/tent-two-person) _PHB_

Simple shelter while adventuring for two. Something something minecraft bed. Once you get _Leomund’s tiny hut_, these become largely obsolete.
