Sure, here are a few examples of special herbs and mushrooms that a druid might find in a corrupted forest:

1.  Nightshade: A purple-flowered plant that grows in dark, damp areas. The leaves and berries of this plant are highly poisonous and can be used in potions or tinctures to induce sleep or paralysis.
    
2.  Bloodroot: A red-flowered plant that grows near water sources. The roots of this plant are bright red and contain a potent poison that can be used in alchemical recipes.
    
3.  Blightcap: A mushroom that grows in areas where the forest has been corrupted by dark magic. The spores of this mushroom can cause hallucinations or even death if ingested, but can also be used to create potent potions or poisons.
    
4.  Starthistle: A flowering plant that grows in open fields or meadows. The flowers of this plant are bright yellow and can be used to make a variety of healing balms and tinctures.
    
5.  Shadowmoss: A dark green moss that grows on the trunks of trees in areas of the forest that are shrouded in shadow. The spores of this moss can be used to create a potent poison that induces weakness or paralysis in those who inhale it.
    
6.  Deathcap: A poisonous mushroom that grows in damp, shady areas of the forest. Eating even a small amount of this mushroom can cause hallucinations, convulsions, and death.
    
7.  Moonwort: A small, delicate plant with pale blue flowers that only grows under the light of the full moon. The leaves of this plant can be used to make a potent sleeping potion.
    
8.  Witch's Bane: A small, purple-flowered plant that grows in areas where the forest has been corrupted by dark magic. The roots of this plant are highly poisonous and can be used to create a potent poison that induces paralysis or death.
    

These herbs and mushrooms could be used by a druid for a variety of purposes, such as creating healing salves, poisons, or potions with specific effects. However, they should be handled with care, as many of them are highly poisonous and can cause serious harm if used improperly.
