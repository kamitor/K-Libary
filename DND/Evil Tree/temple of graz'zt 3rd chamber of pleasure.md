[[temple of Graz'zt]]
[[Dungeons and dragons Session Tree]]

The Chamber of Pleasure is where the cultists of Graz'zt indulge in their most debauched acts. As the players enter, they are struck by the scent of incense, which fills the room and almost seems to cling to their skin. The walls are adorned with paintings and tapestries, depicting scenes of lust and debauchery. The lighting is dim and sultry, casting everything in a warm glow.

The centerpiece of the chamber is a massive bed, adorned with silken sheets and adorned with gold and jewels. The bed is surrounded by pillows and cushions, and nearby is a table stocked with all manner of exotic fruits and delicacies. A number of cultists are lounging on the bed, engaged in various stages of lovemaking. Some of them are scantily clad, while others are completely naked.

The function of this chamber is to provide a place for the cultists to indulge in their carnal desires, and to pay homage to Graz'zt, the demon lord of lust and pleasure. The cultists see these acts as a form of worship, and believe that by indulging in their desires, they are pleasing their master.

The players can interact with various objects in the chamber, such as the table of exotic fruits and delicacies. They may also be able to observe the cultists unnoticed and gain information about the cult and its activities. Alternatively, they may be forced to engage in acts of pleasure themselves, in order to maintain their cover and avoid suspicion.
