[[Dungeons and dragons Session Tree]]

1.  Demonic Glyphs: The cultists of Graz'zt have placed demonic glyphs on the walls and floors of a room, which activate when stepped on. These glyphs can cause various effects, such as summoning demons or causing damage to the party. The only way to safely navigate the room is to use a special amulet or sigil that nullifies the glyphs.
