[[Dungeons and dragons Session Tree]]

Graz'zt's demonic minions come from a wide variety of species, ranging from succubi and incubi to nalfeshnee and balor demons. Some of Graz'zt's most powerful minions are the six demon lords that serve him as vassals, known as the "Six Fingered Hand." These demon lords include:

1.  Baphomet, the demon lord of minotaurs and labyrinths
2.  Dagon, the demon lord of the sea and aquatic creatures
3.  Fraz-Urb'luu, the demon lord of illusions and trickery
4.  Kostchtchie, the demon lord of frost giants and winter
5.  Orcus, the demon lord of undead and necromancy [[Orcus Party]]
6.  Yeenoghu, the demon lord of gnolls and savagery

In addition to these powerful vassals, Graz'zt is also served by a legion of lesser demons, such as mariliths, glabrezus, and hezrous. These minions are often used by the cult of Graz'zt to carry out their dark deeds and terrorize the surrounding lands.
