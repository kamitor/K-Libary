Inquisitor Grey is a devout follower of the god of justice and righteousness, and he has dedicated his life to rooting out evil wherever he finds it. He is a Level 7 Half-Elf Paladin who wears a suit of plate armor, adorned with the symbol of his god - a balance scale with a sword resting on it.

Grey has a stern demeanor, and his face is often set in a serious expression. He carries himself with an air of authority and speaks with a commanding tone. He does not tolerate wrongdoing or injustice, and his uncompromising approach to justice can be intimidating to those around him.

In battle, Grey wields a longsword with deadly precision. He is a skilled fighter and is not afraid to get his hands dirty in combat. He also possesses the ability to smite evil, which allows him to deal extra damage to those who are considered to be truly evil.

As a Paladin, Grey is a vessel of his god's divine power. He has the ability to heal wounds, detect evil, and even lay on hands to cure disease or injury. He uses his divine abilities to aid his allies and punish his enemies.

Grey's unwavering commitment to justice and his god's commandments can make him seem intimidating and even scary to those around him. He does not hesitate to use force when he deems it necessary, and his sense of righteousness can sometimes lead him to make rash decisions. However, he truly believes that he is doing the work of his god, and he will stop at nothing to rid the world of evil.

The name of the deity of Inquisitor Grey is Tyr, also known as the Maimed God. Tyr is the Norse god of justice and is often depicted as a blindfolded warrior with a giant sword.

"Justice is not a choice, it is a duty that I have sworn to uphold. Those who would harm the innocent will feel the full force of my god's wrath."

"I do not seek glory or riches, only to rid the world of evil and bring justice to those who have been wronged."
