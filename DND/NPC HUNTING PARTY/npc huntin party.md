1.  **Emphasize their training and experience:** The NPC party should be portrayed as a highly trained and experienced group of individuals who have honed their skills through years of service. They should be able to anticipate the party's moves and counter them with ease, making it seem like the party is constantly on the defensive.
    
2.  **Use their abilities to their full potential:** Each member of the NPC party has unique abilities that should be used to their full potential. For example, the warlock can summon powerful demons or cast spells that cause fear, while the assassin can sneak up on party members and take them out before they even know what's happening. By showcasing their abilities, the NPC party can seem more intimidating and threatening.
    
3.  **Give them a sense of purpose:** The NPC party should be driven by a sense of purpose that makes them relentless in their pursuit of the party. They could believe that the party is a threat to their mission or that they are protecting the world by eliminating magic users. This sense of purpose makes them seem more determined and dangerous.
    
4.  **Make them ruthless:** The NPC party should not hesitate to use extreme measures to achieve their goals. They should be willing to kill or maim party members to achieve their objectives, making it clear that they are not to be trifled with.
    
5.  **Add a sense of mystery:** Finally, the NPC party should have an air of mystery surrounding them. Perhaps they have access to rare and powerful magical artifacts, or they have ties to a secretive organization that operates behind the scenes. By adding this sense of mystery, the NPC party becomes even more intimidating, as the party is left wondering what other secrets they might be hiding.
