The warforged's deity being nature-aligned, their special weapon could be a sentient weapon that grows stronger as it feeds on the essence of defeated foes.

**Name:** Verdant Devourer

**Weapon Type:** Longsword

**Description:** The hilt of the sword is made of twisted vines and the blade itself appears to be made of living wood, with leaves sprouting from its edges. The sword is imbued with a powerful enchantment that allows it to absorb the life force of those it defeats, making it stronger and more effective in combat.

**Abilities:**

1.  **Verdant Strike:** On a successful attack, the sword can drain a portion of the enemy's life force, dealing an additional 1d6 necrotic damage and restoring the warforged's HP by the same amount.
    
2.  **Sylvan Aura:** As a bonus action, the warforged can call upon the sword to create a 15-foot radius aura of nature's energy. This aura grants all allies within its range temporary hit points equal to the warforged's Charisma modifier.
    
3.  **Nature's Fury:** Once per short rest, the warforged can call upon the sword to unleash a devastating attack. The sword becomes imbued with primal energy and deals an additional 2d8 force damage on its next successful attack.
    

As the warforged continues to use the sword in battle and feed it the life force of their enemies, it may unlock additional abilities or even evolve into a more powerful form.

6.  Twilight falls and shadows grow, The world is bathed in a gentle glow, A time of rest, of peace, and woe, Where memories and dreams may flow
