The Orc camp is located in a desolate valley, nestled between two rocky mountain ridges. It consists of a collection of rough wooden cabins and tents arranged haphazardly around a central clearing. The air is thick with the smell of burning wood and roasting meat, mingled with the pungent odor of unwashed bodies and animal waste.

One unique feature of the camp is a large metal cage situated near the entrance. Inside the cage are several humanoid figures, each suspended from the ceiling by thick chains. They appear to be in a deep sleep or some kind of trance. Another unusual aspect of the camp is the presence of several strange machines and contraptions, which emit a faint humming sound and seem to be constantly in motion.

The orcs themselves are a rough and brutish lot, clad in furs and leather armor and carrying crude weapons. They seem to be constantly in a state of agitation, shouting and cursing at one another and frequently engaging in violent altercations. The refugees, on the other hand, appear to be cowed and submissive, going about their tasks with an air of resignation and fear.

As the party approaches the camp, they can hear the sound of orcish voices and the clatter of metal on stone. They can see a few sentries patrolling the perimeter, but the majority of the orcs seem to be gathered around a central fire pit, cooking and drinking and engaging in raucous revelry.

1.  Tripwire Traps: These traps are triggered when someone trips over a wire strung between two trees. When triggered, a weighted object (such as a log or large rock) falls from above to crush the victim.
    
2.  Pit Traps: These are holes dug in the ground and covered with branches or leaves. When someone steps on the covering, they fall into the pit, which may be filled with spikes or other deadly objects.
    
3.  Poison Gas Traps: These traps release poisonous gas when triggered, causing those in the area to become sick or even die.
    
4.  Alarm Bells: These bells are hung in strategic locations around the camp and are rung when an intruder is detected.
    
5.  Guard Dogs: Trained attack dogs roam the camp, attacking any intruders on sight.
    
6.  Watchtowers: Orc guards patrol watchtowers placed around the perimeter of the camp, keeping an eye out for intruders.
    
7.  False Walls: Some of the walls and structures in the camp are actually just facades, hiding secret tunnels and passages that the orcs use to move around undetected.
    
8.  Booby-Trapped Equipment: The orcs have set up traps on their weapons and equipment, so that if anyone tries to steal them, they'll be hit with an explosive or poisoned dart.
    
9.  Bear Traps: These traps are large, steel jaws that snap shut on a victim's leg, causing them to become trapped and unable to move.
    
10.  Blade Pit: The floor of a room in the camp is rigged to drop away into a pit filled with sharp blades. When triggered, the victim falls into the pit, suffering deadly wounds.
