-   1 x Goristro (CR 17)
-   2 x Dretch (CR 1/4 each)
-   4 x Cult Fanatic (CR 2 each)

The Goristro is a massive, demonic bull-like creature standing at 25 feet tall and weighing over 8,000 pounds. It has a thick hide that is resistant to non-magical weapons, and it wields a massive flail that can cause devastating damage to its foes. The Dretch demons are small and weak, but they can overwhelm their enemies with sheer numbers. The Cult Fanatics are skilled in both melee and ranged combat, and they can also cast spells to further support their allies or hinder their enemies.

Together, this party of enemies provides a diverse set of challenges for the player characters, with the Goristro serving as a deadly bruiser, the Dretch demons as swarmers, and the Cult Fanatics as versatile ranged/melee fighters.

_**Magic Resistance.**_ The Big Slyth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

_**Snake-like Movement.**_ The Big Slyth can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. It can also slither through narrow spaces as small as 2 inches wide without squeezing.

_**Venomous Bite.**_ Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10+5) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

_**Multiattack.**_ The Big Slyth makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.

_**Tail Slap.**_ Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8+5) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

_**Frightful Presence.**_ Each creature of the Big Slyth's choice within 30 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Big Slyth's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

_**Aura of Dark Magic.**_ The area within 30 feet of the Big Slyth is heavily obscured in dim light, and magical darkness fills the area beyond that to a radius of 60 feet. The Big Slyth and creatures friendly to it can see through this darkness as if it weren't there.

_**Legendary Actions.**_ The Big Slyth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Big Slyth regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

-   _**Tail Attack.**_ The Big Slyth makes a tail slap attack.
-   _**Venomous Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).**_ The Big Slyth targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
-   _**Frightful Presence (Costs 3 Actions).**_ The Big Slyth uses its Frightful Presence.

Frightful Presence is an ability that many creatures possess in D&D 5e. When a creature uses this ability, it emanates an aura of fear that can cause its enemies to become frightened. In the case of the Big Slyth, its Frightful Presence is particularly potent.

When the Big Slyth uses its Frightful Presence, all creatures within 60 feet of it that can see it must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Big Slyth's Frightful Presence for 24 hours.

A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within sight. It also can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to the source of its fear, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the creature is no longer frightened.

The Big Slyth's Frightful Presence can be a devastating ability in combat, potentially taking entire groups of enemies out of the fight or forcing them to waste actions attempting to shake off the fear.

**Description**

Nupperibos are demons from the Abyss, but they are often considered to be the lowest of the low in the demon hierarchy. They are small, bloated, slug-like creatures that serve as cannon fodder for more powerful demons. Nupperibos are slow and lumbering, but their putrid bodies are difficult to damage, and they have a natural resistance to cold, fire, lightning, and nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing attacks.

Nupperibos have sharp teeth and claws, and they can attack with both in the same turn. They also have the ability to swallow small or medium-sized creatures whole, although they can only have one creature swallowed at a time. Additionally, they emit a foul stench that can poison creatures within 5 feet of them, making them even more unpleasant to be around.

Overall, nupperibos are not particularly dangerous on their own, but they are often found in groups and can be a nuisance to deal with.
