Village A: "Have you heard of the wizard they call 'Demon Caller' that roams around with a giant tree that devours everything in its path? They say he's the reason the forest is cursed and that he made a pact with a powerful demon to gain his magic."

Village B: "Yes, and what about the firebreathing lizard? They call it 'The Necrotorturer', they say it's a master of necromancy, that it summons the dead and uses them as marionettes to do its bidding. The stories say that its flames are fueled by the souls of the innocent."

Village A: "And don't forget about the thiefling they call 'The Dragon Whisperer'. Rumors say that it's allied with an evil black dragon named Dispayr and that they are plotting something sinister against us. I heard it can communicate with dragons and that it's been seen wearing dragon scales."

Village B: "Oh, and what about that dwarf with an electric guitar? They call him 'The Thunderbeard'. I've heard that he can summon lightning with his music and that his performances can shake the ground. Some say he made a deal with a powerful storm deity to gain his powers."
