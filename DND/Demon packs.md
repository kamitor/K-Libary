-   1 x **Nalfeshnee Demon** (CR 13)
-   2 x **Shadow Demon** (CR 4 each)
-   4 x **Manes Demon** (CR 1/8 each)
The Nalfeshnee is a powerful demon capable of dealing massive damage and imposing debilitating effects on the party. The Shadow Demons are quick and evasive, able to slip in and out of combat with ease. The Manes Demons, while individually weak, can still swarm the party and distract them from the more dangerous demons.

This encounter would be very difficult for a level 6 party, but with good tactics and a bit of luck, they could emerge victoriou
