  
With your party composition at level 4, consisting of a Moon Druid (Aarakocra), a Kobold Blood Hunter, a Scribe Wizard, a Vengeance Oath Paladin, and a Monk (Handmaiden) with Sentinel, you have a diverse set of abilities and potential for some effective combos. Here are some strategies that leverage your party's unique abilities:

### 1. **Frontline and Crowd Control**

- **Moon Druid & Monk/Paladin**: The Druid in Moon form can engage enemies on the frontline, using their beast form to tank damage. The Monk or Paladin can join in, with the Paladin focusing on single-target damage and the Monk using their mobility and Sentinel feat to control enemy movement.
- **Druid's Entangle + Paladin's Smite**: The Druid can cast "Entangle" to restrain enemies, making them easier targets for the Paladin's smite attacks.

### 2. **Aerial Advantage and Ranged Support**

- **Aarakocra's Flight**: Utilize the Aarakocra's ability to fly for scouting and gaining a tactical advantage in positioning, especially for casting spells or avoiding melee combat.
- **Kobold Blood Hunter's Ranged Attacks**: The Kobold can use their racial traits like Pack Tactics to gain advantage on attacks when allies are close to the enemy. This works well with ranged weapons or Blood Hunter abilities.

### 3. **Spell Synergy and Battlefield Control**

- **Scribe Wizard's Versatile Spellcasting**: The Wizard can adapt their spell list to the needs of the day. Spells like "Web" or "Fog Cloud" can control the battlefield, while "Magic Missile" or "Fire Bolt" provide consistent damage.
- **Wizard & Druid Area Control**: Combine spells like the Druid's "Entangle" and the Wizard's "Fog Cloud" or "Web" to control enemy movement and visibility.

### 4. **Focused Target Elimination**

- **Paladin & Blood Hunter Combo**: The Paladin's smite combined with the Blood Hunter's Crimson Rite can focus on taking down a single powerful enemy quickly.
- **Monk's Stunning Strike**: Once the Monk reaches level 5, they can use Stunning Strike to incapacitate key targets, making them vulnerable to focused attacks from the Paladin and Blood Hunter.

### 5. **Defensive Strategies**

- **Druid's Healing & Utility Spells**: The Druid can use spells like "Cure Wounds" or "Healing Word" to keep allies in the fight.
- **Paladin's Lay on Hands**: For emergency healing and curing diseases.

### 6. **Utility and Exploration**

- **Wizard's Ritual Casting**: Use the Wizard's ability to cast rituals for utility spells like "Detect Magic" or "Comprehend Languages" without expending spell slots.
- **Druid's Wild Shape for Exploration**: The Druid can use Wild Shape for scouting or overcoming natural obstacles.

### General Tips:

- **Communication**: Always communicate and plan your strategies before engaging in combat.
- **Adaptability**: Be ready to adapt your strategy based on the enemies and the environment.
- **Positioning**: Make sure to position yourselves in a way that maximizes your abilities and minimizes exposure to enemy attacks.

Remember, the effectiveness of these combos can vary depending on the specific scenario and enemy you are facing. Always be ready to adjust your tactics as the situation changes.

Use actual spells and attack combo's to simulate options and actually find intresting combinations. The combination has to be able to happen in 1 to two turns. For example the druids entangle can be used to trap enemies so that the paladin can more quickly close in, since her movement speed is 25 (as a dwarf)

Given your party's composition and the requirement for combos that can be executed within 1 to 2 turns, here are some specific and synergistic combinations using actual spells and attacks:

### 1. **Druid's Entangle + Paladin's Divine Smite**

- **Turn 1**:
    - **Druid**: Casts "Entangle" to restrain enemies within a 20-foot square, forcing them to make a Strength saving throw or be restrained.
    - **Others**: Position themselves strategically, preparing for attacks next turn.
- **Turn 2**:
    - **Paladin**: Moves in to attack a restrained enemy. The restrained condition grants advantage on attack rolls against the affected creatures, making it easier for the Paladin to hit and apply "Divine Smite" for extra damage.

### 2. **Wizard's Web + Blood Hunter's Ranged Attacks**

- **Turn 1**:
    - **Wizard**: Casts "Web" to create difficult terrain and potentially restrain enemies (Dexterity saving throw to avoid).
    - **Blood Hunter**: Positions for a clear line of sight, possibly using a bonus action for "Crimson Rite" to add elemental damage to their attacks.
- **Turn 2**:
    - **Blood Hunter**: Takes advantage of restrained enemies (if any are caught in the web) to make ranged attacks with advantage.

### 3. **Monk's Flurry of Blows + Paladin's Compelled Duel**

- **Turn 1**:
    - **Paladin**: Casts "Compelled Duel" on a key enemy target, drawing their attention and limiting their ability to attack others.
    - **Monk**: Engages another enemy, using "Flurry of Blows" for multiple attacks.
- **Turn 2**:
    - **Paladin and Monk**: Focus their attacks on their respective engaged enemies, with the Paladin using smites and the Monk using their mobility and additional unarmed strikes to control and damage their foe.

### 4. **Druid's Faerie Fire + Kobold's Pack Tactics**

- **Turn 1**:
    - **Druid**: Casts "Faerie Fire", which outlines enemies in light and grants advantage on attack rolls against them.
    - **Kobold Blood Hunter**: Prepares or repositions for an attack next turn.
- **Turn 2**:
    - **Kobold Blood Hunter**: Utilizes Pack Tactics to gain advantage on attack rolls (further ensured by "Faerie Fire") and attacks with enhanced accuracy and damage.

### 5. **Wizard's Fog Cloud + Monk's Sentinel**

- **Turn 1**:
    - **Wizard**: Casts "Fog Cloud" to heavily obscure an area, disorienting enemies and disrupting their ranged attacks.
    - **Monk**: Positions themselves at the edge of the fog to intercept enemies that emerge.
- **Turn 2**:
    - **Monk**: Uses the Sentinel feat to attack enemies that try to move out of the fog, potentially stopping their movement and keeping them in the obscured area.

### General Strategy Notes:

- **Adapt to Enemy Reactions**: Enemies might react unpredictably to your actions, so be prepared to adapt.
- **Use Terrain**: Consider how the environment can enhance these combos (e.g., using "Entangle" in a forested area).
- **Coordinate Attacks**: Ensure that the party members are aware of each other's plans to maximize the effectiveness of these combos.

These combos are just examples and can be modified based on the specific circumstances of your encounters. Remember, the key to successful combos in D&D is not just the abilities themselves, but how creatively and effectively you can use them together.
