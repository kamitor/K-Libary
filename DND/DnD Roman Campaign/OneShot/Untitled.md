# Introduction


Opening Narrative (5 mins)Dr Welcome to the ancient Dour, an old dwarven mining town, now occupied by goblins and other creatures the go in the dark. Your journey begins at the Bridge of **Titanus**, a massive stone structure spanning a chasm so deep that its bottom is lost to darkness. The players start standing over a large bridge, with mysterious with strange symbols carved into the entrance. 

The ancient defense mechanism on the Bridge of Titanus is a marvel of Dwarven engineering and magic, designed to protect the city of Dour from invaders. This system is intricately tied to the runes carved into the center of the bridge. When activated, these runes unleash a series of defensive measures that can either protect the adventurers or pose additional challenges depending on how they interact with the mechanism.

**Bridge of Titanus Details:**

- **Width:** 20 feet
- **Length:** 100 feet
- **Height:** 300 feet above the chasm floor
- **Condition:** Ancient and cracked, with sections missing or weakened 

The bridge, though grand, shows the signs of its age. The stone is worn and cracked, and sections of the bridge are missing or precariously weakened. These gaps and crumbling edges make traversal dangerous, demanding caution and surefootedness.

The centerpiece of the bridge is a series of intricate runes, glowing faintly with a magical light. These runes are not merely decorative; they are part of an ancient defense system. When activated, they can summon protective barriers of flame, shielding the bridge from would-be attackers and creating an impenetrable wall of fire.

The ancient defense mechanism on the Bridge of Titanus, once a marvel of Dwarven engineering, has been dormant for centuries. The goblins, having discovered the bridge and its defenses, have found a crude yet effective way to manipulate the system to their advantage.

#### **Mechanism Activation and Effects**

**Visuals and Sounds:**

- **Activation:** As the adventurers approach the bridge and disturb the central runes, the symbols glow faintly, trying to reawaken the ancient defenses. The machinery beneath the bridge groans to life, causing the bridge to shudder.
- **Sound Alerts:** An ancient Dwarven voice, now garbled and inconsistent due to disrepair, echoes warnings: "System... error... Intruders... detected... Defense mechanisms... engaging..."
- **Alarm:** The clanging of rusted gears and the hiss of escaping steam indicate the faltering activation of the defense system.

#### **Original Dwarven Mechanism**

The dwarves who built the Bridge of Titanus designed a series of runes at the center of the bridge. When activated in the correct sequence, these runes would create a protective barrier of flames to deter invaders. However, there was also a way for dwarves to safely pass through by using specific pressure points and rune sequences.

#### **Narrative Description as Players Start:**

**As you step onto the bridge, the cold air from the chasm below sends a shiver down your spine. The bridge stretches out before you, a testament to Dwarven engineering and resilience. The symbols carved into the stone at your feet hum with a faint, ancient power, hinting at the formidable defenses they once provided.**

**Looking around, you see the remnants of the dwarven glory days—intricate carvings of dwarven heroes and craftsmen adorn the sides of the bridge, now faded and worn by time. The air is heavy with the scent of damp stone and the faint, unsettling smell of goblin encampments ahead. From the depths of the chasm, the sound of rushing water or perhaps something more sinister echoes up, adding to the tension.**

**As you venture further, you notice that some sections of the bridge are severely weakened, with stones missing and cracks wide enough to catch a boot. Careful navigation will be crucial to avoid falling into the abyss below. The runes at the center of the bridge glow a bit brighter as you approach, as if sensing your presence.**

**Perception Check:**

- **DC 15:** Characters notice weak spots in the bridge and potential ambush points where goblins might be hiding.

The glow from the runes begins to intensify, casting eerie shadows on the bridge and creating an ominous atmosphere. These runes are the key to the bridge's ancient defensive mechanism. Once activated, they will unleash torrents of flame from hidden channels along the sides of the bridge, creating a barrier that can either protect you or turn against you if not handled correctly.

**Suddenly, the faint sound of goblin chatter reaches your ears, echoing through the cavern. The tension mounts as you realize that the first challenge of your mission is imminent. Are you ready to reclaim the city of Dour and face the dangers that lie ahead?**

### **Narrative Flow for the Goblin War Camp Encounter:**

**DM:** "As you move beyond the Bridge of Titanus, the cavern opens up into a sprawling goblin war camp. Tents and weapon racks are scattered throughout, with watchtowers manned by goblin archers. Near the back of the camp, you see prison pens holding captured dwarves and a heavily guarded supply depot. The goblins, adopting crude Roman tactics, form phalanxes and shield walls as they patrol the area."

**Setting:** After crossing the Bridge of Titanus, the adventurers enter a vast cavern where the goblins have established a war camp. This camp serves as a staging area for their incursions into the deeper parts of the dwarven city.

**Objective:** Navigate through the heavily guarded goblin war camp without raising the alarm or triggering an all-out assault.

**Layout:**

- **Main Camp:** Central area filled with goblin tents, weapon racks, and makeshift fortifications.
- **Watchtowers:** Elevated platforms with goblin archers keeping an eye out for intruders.
- **Prison Pens:** Enclosures holding captured dwarves and other creatures.
- **Supply Depot:** Area stocked with stolen goods and weapons, guarded by hobgoblins.

### **Objective:**

Navigate through the heavily guarded goblin war camp without raising the alarm or triggering an all-out assault.

**Challenges:**

1. **Stealth and Reconnaissance (15 mins):**
    
    - **Objective:** Avoid detection while scouting the camp.
    - **Skill Checks:** Dexterity (Stealth) DC 14 to move unnoticed. Wisdom (Perception) DC 15 to spot patrol routes and hidden dangers.
    - **Consequences:** Failure may result in raising the alarm, triggering reinforcements (additional goblin warriors and a goblin boss).

1. **Rescue the Prisoners (15 mins):**
    
    - **Objective:** Free the dwarven prisoners to gain their aid and avoid potential alerts.
    - **Skill Checks:** Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) DC 14 to pick locks or Strength (Athletics) DC 16 to break open cages. Charisma (Persuasion) DC 12 to calm and convince the prisoners to follow quietly.
    - **Consequences:** Failure may cause a commotion, alerting nearby guards.
 
##### Dwarven prison
 **Description:** The prison pens, made of sturdy logs and scavenged metal, contain the weary forms of captured dwarves. Some sit with heads bowed, while others pace restlessly, their eyes darting nervously toward the camp's entrance.
 
 Interaction:

1. **Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) to Pick Locks:**
    
    - A character proficient in thieves' tools or skilled in manual dexterity can attempt to quietly pick the locks on the prison cages. Success means the cage springs open without a sound.

1. **Strength (Athletics) to Break Open Cages:**
    
    - Alternatively, a character may opt for brute force, attempting to pry the cage bars apart or smash the locks with sheer strength. This method risks making noise but can be quicker.
3. **Charisma (Persuasion) to Calm the Prisoners:**
    
    - Before attempting any rescue, the party may choose to reassure the dwarven captives, calming their fears and gaining their cooperation. A successful persuasion check convinces them to follow quietly, reducing the risk of an alert.

**Consequences:** Failure in any of these tasks risks alerting nearby guards. The clatter of broken locks or the panicked cries of the dwarves could draw unwanted attention, prompting goblin patrols to investigate.

**Dwarven Prisoners:** The prisoners consist of five dwarves, each with their own unique appearance and demeanor. Though wearied by their captivity, their spirits lift at the sight of potential rescuers.

#### Kragmar's Fury:
In the ancient annals of dwarfkind, there exists a grim saga known as "Kragmar's Fury," a malady that seizes the hearts of dwarves, granting them unparalleled strength in battle but at a dire cost to body and mind.

**The Affliction:**

Kragmar's Fury is a devastating affliction that ravages the minds and bodies of dwarves, imbuing them with a frenzied battle rage akin to the ferocity of a raging storm. It manifests as a potent and addictive substance, a crystalline form known as "Kragmar's Tear," which, when ingested, unleashes a surge of adrenaline and primal fury.

### **Symptoms:**

- **Euphoric Elation:** Those under the influence of Kragmar's Fury experience a euphoric rush, accompanied by heightened senses and a surge of energy that borders on the supernatural.
- **Unyielding Strength:** Afflicted dwarves become imbued with an unnatural strength and resilience, capable of feats of physical prowess that defy explanation.
- **Feral Berserker Rage:** In battle, they succumb to a berserker frenzy, heedless of their own safety as they unleash a torrent of blows upon their foes with reckless abandon.
- **Physical Deterioration:** Prolonged use of Kragmar's Tear exacts a heavy toll on the body, causing muscles to swell and joints to ache, while the mind becomes increasingly clouded and erratic.

### **Origins:**

The origins of Kragmar's Fury are shrouded in mystery, whispered of in hushed tones among the dwarven clans. Some say it was first discovered deep within the heart of the mountains, a crystalline deposit left behind by an ancient titan of stone. Others believe it to be the creation of dark sorcery, a malevolent curse unleashed upon the world by a vengeful deity.

### **Effects on Society:**

Communities afflicted by Kragmar's Fury find themselves torn asunder by the insidious influence of the substance. Warriors who partake of its power become revered as champions of their kin, their prowess in battle unmatched by any foe. Yet, beneath their veneer of strength lies a fractured spirit, their minds consumed by the relentless hunger for more of the intoxicating substance.

### **Treatment:**

the ancient songs of the dwarven bards. Through centuries of tradition and cultural heritage, these melodies carry within them the key to unlocking the shackles of the affliction.

**Setting:** Beyond the goblin war camp, the adventurers discover the Ancient Dwarven Forge, a once-great facility now corrupted by dark magic. The forge is essential to understanding the deeper mysteries of the mountain and holds clues to the city’s downfall.

**Objective:** Investigate the forge, solve its puzzles, and cleanse it of dark magic to gain access to the deeper parts of the mountain.

**Layout:**

- **Entrance Hall:** A grand hall leading to the main forge area, filled with ancient dwarven statues and partially collapsed columns.
- **Main Forge:** The heart of the facility, with a massive forge at its center, now emitting an eerie glow.
- **Control Room:** A hidden chamber with mechanisms controlling the forge’s functions.

### The entrance
As the adventurers approach the entrance to the Ancient Dwarven Forge, they are met with an unsettling sight—a towering stone door adorned with ancient dwarven runes, its surface crackling with arcane energy. Despite its imposing presence, the door emits strange noises, flickering lights, and occasional bursts of smoke, evidence of a malfunction that has plagued it for ages.



**Challenges:**

1. **Restoring the Forge’s Power (15 mins):**
    
    - **Objective:** Reactivate the forge’s power source by solving a complex puzzle.
    - **Puzzle Details:** The forge is powered by a series of elemental crystals that need to be placed in the correct order. Each crystal represents an element (fire, water, earth, air), and the correct sequence is hinted at through inscriptions around the room.
    - **Skill Checks:** Intelligence (Arcana) DC 15 to understand the elemental connections. Wisdom (Perception) DC 14 to find the inscriptions. Intelligence (Investigation) DC 14 to determine the correct order.
    - **Consequence:** Incorrect placement may trigger elemental traps (fire bursts, water floods, earth tremors, air gusts), causing 2d6 damage of the respective type.



1. **Cleansing the Dark Magic (15 mins):**
    
    - **Objective:** Purge the forge of the corruption by performing a ritual or using powerful magic.
    - **Skill Checks:** Intelligence (Religion) or Wisdom (Insight) DC 15 to understand the nature of the corruption. Charisma (Persuasion) DC 14 to invoke the aid of dwarven spirits.
    - **Combat Encounter:** As the ritual progresses, corrupted elemental beings emerge to stop the adventurers.
        - **Corrupted Fire Elemental:** (MM p. 125) (HP: 102, AC: 13)
        - **Corrupted Earth Elemental:** (MM p. 124) (HP: 126, AC: 17)
    - **Consequences:** Failure to cleanse the forge results in ongoing corruption and weakened forge power, making further exploration more dangerous.
3. **Reactivating the Control Room (15 mins):**
    
    - **Objective:** Gain control of the forge’s mechanisms to open the path deeper into the mountain.
    - **Skill Checks:** Intelligence (History) DC 13 to understand the ancient controls. Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) DC 14 to manipulate the mechanisms.
    - **Environmental Hazards:** The room may have traps or guardians activated by incorrect lever pulls (Dexterity saving throw DC 14 to avoid 2d6 damage from traps).

**Outcome:** Successfully restoring and cleansing the forge provides the adventurers with vital information and resources, as well as a safe passage deeper into the mountain. Failure results in increased danger and ongoing corruption.
# **Showdown - 45 mins**

**Showdown: The Clash of Forces**

As the adventurers navigate through the treacherous labyrinth of the goblin war camp, they find themselves confronted by a convergence of ancient dwarven runes and goblin machinations. This final showdown pits the forces of darkness against the light of hope, as the fate of the captive dwarves hangs in the balance.

### **The Convergence of Runes and Machinations:**

In the heart of the goblin war camp, a chamber lies shrouded in darkness, its walls adorned with ancient dwarven runes etched in stone. These runes, remnants of a bygone era, pulse with a faint, ethereal light, their magic intertwined with the very fabric of the cavern itself.

Meanwhile, the goblin encampment bustles with frenetic activity, as crude contraptions and makeshift barricades are hastily erected in anticipation of the adventurers' arrival. The goblins, emboldened by their newfound power and fueled by the promise of conquest, stand ready to defend their territory at any cost.

### **The Duel of Magics:**

As the adventurers step into the chamber, they are met with a sight both awe-inspiring and terrifying. The ancient dwarven runes flicker to life, their magic resonating with the latent energy of the cavern. In response, the goblin contraptions hum with dark power, their crude mechanisms infused with the twisted magic of their creators.

A fierce battle ensues, as the adventurers clash with the goblin forces in a duel of magics and steel. Arcane energies crackle through the air, accompanied by the clang of swords and the roar of battle cries. With each spell cast and each blow struck, the balance of power shifts, as the fate of the captive dwarves hangs in the balance.

### **The Unraveling of Darkness:**

As the battle rages on, cracks begin to form in the fabric of the goblin encampment, as the ancient dwarven runes exert their influence over the cavern. Crude barriers crumble, and enchanted defenses falter, as the forces of darkness are gradually pushed back by the overwhelming tide of magic.

With a final surge of determination, the adventurers press forward, their resolve unyielding in the face of adversity. As they unleash their most powerful spells and unleash devastating attacks, the darkness begins to unravel, until at last, the goblin war camp lies in ruins, its defenders scattered and defeated.

### **The Triumph of Light:**

With the goblin threat vanquished and the captive dwarves liberated, the adventurers stand triumphant amidst the wreckage of the war camp. The ancient dwarven runes glow with renewed vigor, their magic pulsing with the promise of a brighter future. And as the echoes of battle fade into the depths of the mountain, the dwarves raise their voices in song, a hymn of victory that reverberates through the halls of their ancestral home.
