**Magic Resistance:** The treant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons:** The treant's weapon attacks are magical.

**Rejuvenation:** If the treant dies, its body disintegrates into a cloud of leaves and branches, leaving behind no physical form. After 24 hours, the treant reappears in its lair with a new body, regaining all its hit points and spell slots.

**Actions**

**Multiattack.** The treant makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

**Blood Drain.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 12 (2d6 + 5) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**Entangling Roots.** The treant causes grasping roots and vines to sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within 120 feet of it. For 1 minute or until the treant uses this action again, that area is difficult terrain for non-plant creatures. In addition, each creature of the treant's choice that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or become restrained until the entangle ends.


The Vampiric Treant is a fearsome and twisted creature that strikes terror into the hearts of any who dare to venture into the dark and foreboding forests where it dwells. Towering over all other trees, its massive trunk is covered in thick, gnarled bark that appears almost black in the dim light of the forest. Its twisted roots extend deep into the earth, anchoring it firmly in place and allowing it to draw sustenance from the very soil itself.

The branches of the Vampiric Treant are gnarled and twisted, bearing sharp thorns and jagged leaves that seem to quiver with an almost palpable hunger. The tree's eyes are hollow pits of blackness, and its bark is crisscrossed with deep furrows that run with the sap of its victims. In the moonlight, the Vampiric Treant appears almost spectral, a haunting and malevolent presence that seems to embody the very essence of the dark and twisted forest it inhabits.

At the base of the tree, a gaping maw filled with razor-sharp teeth opens wide, revealing the creature's insatiable hunger for the blood of living creatures. Vines and tendrils coil and writhe around its trunk, their sinuous movements betraying the creature's predatory nature. To encounter a Vampiric Treant is to face a foe that is both powerful and ancient, a creature that has endured for centuries and feeds upon the life force of all who dare to cross its path.



## Blight

Blights are twisted, corrupted plant creatures that are infused with dark magic. They are often found in areas where evil magic or demonic forces have tainted the land, such as dark forests or corrupted groves. Blights come in several different forms, each corresponding to a different type of tree or plant. Some of the most common types of blights include twig blights, needle blights, and vine blights.

Twig blights are small, twig-like creatures that resemble walking sticks. They are often found in large groups and are capable of overwhelming unwary travelers with sheer numbers. Needle blights are humanoid-shaped creatures that are covered in needle-like protrusions. They are often used as guards or sentries by more powerful plant creatures. Vine blights are larger and more powerful than twig or needle blights. They resemble walking vines and are capable of ensnaring and strangling their foes.
