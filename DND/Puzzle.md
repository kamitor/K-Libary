Sure! So for this puzzle, let's say there are three animals involved: a wolf, a rabbit, and a deer. The symbols are as follows:

-   The symbol for the wolf is a simple silhouette of a wolf, with a triangle-shaped nose and pointed ears.
-   The symbol for the rabbit is a circle with two long ears extending upwards.
-   The symbol for the deer is a triangle with two points extending upwards, resembling antlers.

The players will come across a door with three slots, each with one of these symbols above it. In order to progress, they must place a stone with the correct symbol into each slot. However, there are a few hints that will help them figure out which symbol goes where:

-   On the door itself, there are three smaller symbols that correspond to each animal: a paw print for the wolf, a carrot for the rabbit, and a set of antlers for the deer.
-   In the nearby area, the players will find three small statues, each depicting one of the animals. These statues will have an inscription on the base that provides a clue as to which symbol corresponds to that animal.
-   Finally, the players may be able to communicate with some of the animals in the forest using Selene's abilities. If they can ask the animals about the door, they may receive hints about which symbol goes where.


The puzzle consists of a series of animal symbols etched into stones or painted on trees, each representing a different animal in the forest. The players will need to decipher which symbols correspond to which animals in order to navigate the correct path through the forest.

The symbols may be difficult to interpret at first glance, requiring the players to make use of clues in the environment or their own knowledge of the forest. For example, a symbol of a deer with a single antler might correspond to a rare, one-horned deer that is only found in a particular area of the forest.

Additionally, the players may encounter other animals in the forest that can provide hints or guidance. Perhaps a wise old owl can offer a clue about the symbol for a particular bird, or a mischievous squirrel can lead the players to the correct path by scattering acorns in a certain direction.

The puzzle should be challenging enough to require some effort on the part of the players, but not so difficult that it becomes frustrating or impossible. It should also be possible for the players to overcome it without resorting to combat, allowing them to make use of their intelligence and problem-solving skills.
