INTRO
C         G        Am      F
Woke up this morning, turned on the screen,
C         G        Am      F
Another day of work, the same old routine,
C         G        Am      F
Emails and messages, they never stop,
C         G        Am      F
Got to find a way to rise to the top.

VERSE 1
Am        G        F      C
Step by step, I take a breath,
Am        G        F      C
Trying to find a way to do my best,
Am        G        F      C
In this world of digital and real,
Am        G        F      G
We need to find a way to make it all feel...real.

### **Chorus**
C G A F
Boom boom, give me a room,  
We want to work together, but not on Zoom,  
Face to face, let's find our space,
CGAG
Blend the offline and the online space

BRIDGE
Let's [F]meet in the middle, find a common [C]ground,
Where we can [Am]share ideas without a single [G]sound,
To[F]gether we'll create, together we'll [C]inspire,
In a [Am]space that's free from [G]wires.


### **Verse 2**
C G A F
Sitting at my desk, I'm feeling the strain,  
Staring at the screen, it's driving me insane,  
Need a little break, need a little time,  
To get my head straight, and feel just fine.

### **Pre-Chorus**
Am        G        F      C
Step by step, I take av breath,  
Trying to find a way to do my best,  
In this world of digital and real,  
We need to find a way to make it real.

### **Chorus**
C G A F
Boom boom, give me a room,  
We want to work together, but not on Zoom,  
Face to face, let's find our pace,  
Blend the off and the online space.

### **Outro**
Am        G        F      C
So take a breath and think step by step,  
We'll find our groove, there's no need to fret,  
In this hybrid world, we'll make our way,  
Working together, day by day.
